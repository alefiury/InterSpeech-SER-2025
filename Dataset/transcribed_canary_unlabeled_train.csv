MSP-PODCAST_0091_0155.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.8,214,Female,Train, It's one of those questions you have to ask.
MSP-PODCAST_0091_0177.wav,X,4.6,3.4,4.8,214,Female,Train," Wow, They should just rename the C. B. I. shouldn't they?"

MSP-PODCAST_0094_0006.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.4,535,Male,Train, Kribling gets a lot of crap on the internet for you know being a lame character sometimes you know he dies a lot and then.
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0010.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.4,536,Male,Train," Krillin I feel like he always gets made fun of, but really he is incredibly strong and is actually a very good character."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0011.wav,X,5.4,4.6,4.4,536,Male,Train," For example, Krillin is underpowered against almost every enemy."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0015.wav,X,4.2,4.4,4.2,535,Male,Train," What I've always thought interesting about Carlin was he's a human and he's fighting with Saiyads, you know. He's one of he's."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0020.wav,X,3.6,4.4,4.4,535,Male,Train," You know, alongside Saiyans, who are, you know, the most powerful fives in the universe."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0022.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.4,536,Male,Train," The Saiyans are a race of fighters and Goku, Vegeta, Trunks, Gohan pretty much by the end of this, you know, series."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0024.wav,X,4.2,2.4,3.4,536,Male,Train, And another point on why I think Krillin is absolutely relevant is because
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0028.wav,X,6.0,5.8,5.4,535,Male,Train, that extra push of anger or something to give them the ability
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0029.wav,X,3.8,4.6,3.8,535,Male,Train," At first, at least. And I thought it was interesting that."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0051.wav,X,5.2,5.4,5.8,535,Male,Train, Scri that was probably one of my least favorite parts for Carlin is him not disabling the Androids.
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0052.wav,X,4.6,4.6,5.0,535,Male,Train, But I really felt like it would have been detrimental to the whole story and actually the development of other characters.
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0053.wav,X,4.0,3.4,3.6,535,Male,Train," Without the final struggle to defeat Sell, I don't think Gohan would have reached the level that he was at at that age."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0055.wav,X,4.4,4.6,4.6,535,Male,Train, The the demise of Cell really helped a lot of the characters.
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0062.wav,X,3.4,3.2,3.0,536,Male,Train," Android eighteen, because it makes them actually seem human."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0066.wav,X,3.4,2.8,4.2,535,Male,Train, I don't I don't dislike Crillon as a character. He's actually one of my favorite because he is relatable. He is a human and you have to realize that.
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0068.wav,X,3.8,3.8,4.6,535,Male,Train," But they're, they have a different level of that. You know, Krillin is on our level still, and he, we have to remind ourselves that he is a human and he is"
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0069.wav,X,5.4,4.8,5.0,535,Male,Train," You know, risking his life, he has, you know, of course he gets wished back and everything, but he is a human life, you know."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0070.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.6,536,Male,Train, And another example actually shows Krillin is pretty strong.
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0072.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.8,536,Male,Train," Krillin until he stopped to, you know, check up on Goku, who was injured from cell."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0073.wav,X,4.0,3.8,3.4,536,Male,Train," was holding his own, whereas the Saiyans had to turn Super Saiyan."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0079.wav,X,4.2,3.8,5.0,535,Male,Train," That's my opinion, of course, but."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0081.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.8,535,Male,Train, And he turned his back and he got a cheap shot from one of the cell juniors.
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0084.wav,X,5.6,4.8,5.0,535,Male,Train," Um, while you know, all most of the characters were including Yamcha."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0091.wav,X,4.4,3.8,4.4,535,Male,Train, blood drawn from Napa and it was caused by Krillin and that really shows even before Goku was able to get there Krillin was probably the most powerful fighter on that field.
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0101.wav,X,4.4,4.8,5.2,535,Male,Train," When he's a, you know, child and stuff and he decides that, you know, the last fight I think he really does is he's gonna participate in the world martial arts tournament."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0103.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.6,535,Male,Train," But I mean, I think one of the interesting things about Krillin is he kind of puts himself down most of the show."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0107.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.4,536,Male,Train," Well, that was mostly because Goku was injured from fighting Cell."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0108.wav,X,2.6,3.4,3.0,536,Male,Train," True. So I wouldn't say that necessarily Krillin is at the same level, but he does hold his own."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0109.wav,X,3.8,3.8,4.2,535,Male,Train," Yeah, I mean he holds his head and he doesn't give himself that credit, I think."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0117.wav,X,4.4,5.0,4.4,535,Male,Train," Yeah, yeah, definitely. I think that Krillin is what kind of makes Goku human in a sense."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0120.wav,X,3.4,4.2,3.8,535,Male,Train," Krillin is is almost like Goku's right hand man without ever being said, you know."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0121.wav,X,4.2,4.6,3.6,536,Male,Train," And I think for that, that makes Krillin a very relevant and respectable character."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0125.wav,X,4.6,3.8,4.2,535,Male,Train," Yeah, Goku is, you know, technically the world's savior with most of the fights, but he doesn't do it alone. I feel like Krillin helps Goku a lot."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0129.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.4,536,Male,Train," As a fighter, Crillon is very strong, and holds his own, and between him and Tian are arguably the strongest humans, I'd say."
MSP-PODCAST_0094_0131.wav,X,4.4,4.8,5.4,535,Male,Train, This has been episode one and we've been talking about Krillin.

MSP-PODCAST_2394_0185.wav,X,5.0,5.0,3.0,1336,Female,Train, So the content review team has a lot of interaction with the policy teams that create the policies or the rules for what should be accepted or not.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0193.wav,X,5.0,4.0,4.0,1336,Female,Train," Um, that could be happening behind the scenes as well."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0194.wav,X,3.8,4.0,4.8,1336,Female,Train," Well, and so for the Trust and Safety Professional Association."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0203.wav,X,4.0,3.0,4.0,1336,Female,Train," ensure that they're keeping users safe. So, you know, the reason for the expanded view is sort of the."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0220.wav,X,4.0,4.0,5.0,480,Male,Train," And so actually that takes me to my next question, which is, you know, one of the things that I've done."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0243.wav,X,3.0,5.0,3.0,1336,Female,Train, People have opinions and sometimes those opinions can be really harmful or hurtful to other people.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0256.wav,X,3.8,4.8,4.0,480,Male,Train, And I think even people who are starting companies where they're going to be hosting third party speech don't.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0272.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.0,480,Male,Train," It's about you know, your setting up a platform or a community or whatever it is, the kind of site that you want."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0276.wav,X,5.0,4.0,3.0,480,Male,Train, And safety function. And I think it's a perfect example. I think it is a trust and safety function. And if you start to.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0313.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.0,1337,Female,Train, It's something that a lot of people don't really think about when they think.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0320.wav,X,4.0,4.0,5.0,480,Male,Train," Admittedly, there are some companies that don't think it's."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0331.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.2,480,Male,Train, with the customer generally.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0333.wav,X,5.0,5.0,4.0,480,Male,Train," You know, designing features, designing products to actually take into"
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0336.wav,X,3.0,5.0,3.0,480,Male,Train," As internet platforms operate, I think it's going to become more and more important."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0359.wav,X,5.0,5.0,4.5,1336,Female,Train," through, okay, like how do we mainstream these concepts of abuse mitigation within the product and engineering teams?"
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0362.wav,X,5.0,3.0,5.0,1336,Female,Train, I think the conversation is changing. I think there's a lot more.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0372.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.0,1336,Female,Train," But I also think that companies need to be really listening to the trust and safety professionals who have been doing this for a while to really understand how to, you know,"
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0373.wav,X,4.0,5.0,5.0,1336,Female,Train, make that mainstream that into a part of the product development cycle.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0379.wav,X,3.0,5.0,5.0,480,Male,Train, Get a better sense of it is that the people who are.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0390.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.0,480,Male,Train," reasons or whatever it might be is, you know, that's that's."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0408.wav,X,4.0,5.0,5.0,1336,Female,Train," You know, when you're actually sitting in the company, it's kind of challenging for the companies themselves to explain all the ins and outs of how they came to a decision."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0426.wav,X,5.0,3.0,3.0,480,Male,Train," Yeah, yeah, no, and we're excited to be working on those as well for basically the same reason."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0430.wav,X,4.0,4.0,5.0,480,Male,Train," Trust and Safety Foundation website, and we're going to continue to build out that library for a while because there seem to be more and more case studies that"
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0434.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.0,480,Male,Train," The show Radio Lab did, they did two years."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0446.wav,X,3.0,3.0,4.0,480,Male,Train, is recognize all of these different cases and understand where it comes from.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0449.wav,X,5.833333,4.166667,4.166667,480,Male,Train, So the more information that's out there and the more ways that people could begin to recognize how challenging.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0459.wav,X,5.5,5.0,4.5,480,Male,Train," I'm excited that that you guys are, you know, hopefully we'll begin to educate the world."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0460.wav,X,5.0,3.0,5.0,1336,Female,Train," As a trusted safety professional, I salute you."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0465.wav,X,5.0,3.0,5.0,1337,Female,Train," You know, as the online issues, as the online communities and issues that even."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0469.wav,X,4.0,4.0,5.0,480,Male,Train," Great. Yeah, I mean, I was, I was gonna ask, I mean, I know you just launched, but you know, like what, what else is next, what?"
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0479.wav,X,5.0,3.0,5.0,1337,Female,Train, I think Adelaide can share a couple.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0484.wav,X,5.0,3.0,4.0,1337,Female,Train, So that's something that we're going to continue to build out over the next eighteen months.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0486.wav,X,3.0,5.0,4.0,1337,Female,Train, If you go ahead and look up any kind of trust and safety job description.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0489.wav,X,6.0,6.0,5.0,1337,Female,Train," Today. And so, yeah, you know, something like that is a really good one on one training."
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0508.wav,X,4.0,4.0,3.0,480,Male,Train, One of the more annoying parts of many of these conversations is the idea that it only.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0511.wav,X,3.0,3.0,4.0,480,Male,Train, Or that they're outside of the scope of.
MSP-PODCAST_2394_0559.wav,X,5.0,5.0,3.0,480,Male,Train, Organizations and putting all this together. I know that both of you have been working really.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0010.wav,X,3.0,3.0,4.0,480,Male,Train, We had Senator Josh Hawley introduce his bill to somewhat limit
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0025.wav,X,5.0,3.0,3.0,480,Male,Train, So today on the podcast to talk about both of these proposals.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0041.wav,X,3.0,5.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train, Goldman have pointed out most section two hundred and thirty cases end up hinging on.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0043.wav,X,3.0,5.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train, of how Section two hundred and thirty protects free speech online. The Holly Bill would make that protection.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0054.wav,X,2.8,3.8,3.0,1333,Female,Train, Because one of the kind of key things to understand about content moderation at scale online is it is.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0061.wav,X,3.4,4.2,4.2,1333,Female,Train, When you are hosting material at that scale.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0074.wav,X,5.0,4.0,3.0,1333,Female,Train, We're not going to promise much of anything in our content policies. We're going to take a.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0110.wav,X,3.0,5.0,5.0,1334,Female,Train, They could just snap their fingers and make happen.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0111.wav,X,4.0,5.0,4.0,1334,Female,Train," I'm looking at the text of his language, and I think that he certainly intends that everybody writes a very specific content policy."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0114.wav,X,4.0,4.0,5.0,1334,Female,Train," But I'm not entirely sure that would be the effect. I think that basically all of a sudden, terms of service are going to look like we reserve the right to be completely armed."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0121.wav,X,5.0,4.0,4.0,1334,Female,Train, forms normally are subject to market pressure to do what their users want if they want to attract consistent
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0132.wav,X,4.0,4.0,5.0,480,Male,Train, moderation choices of the various platforms is targeting
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0133.wav,X,3.8,4.0,4.0,480,Male,Train," one particular set of political views. Now, people get very mad at me when I say there's no evidence for that, but I stand by it."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0138.wav,X,5.0,4.0,3.0,480,Male,Train, They're not paying attention to the cases that go against that viewpoint.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0149.wav,X,3.0,5.0,5.0,480,Male,Train, They let my friends game the system to get their abusive or false information online without it being moderated in some form or another.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0152.wav,X,5.0,3.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train," Because with both of those together, that is a."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0156.wav,X,5.0,3.0,4.0,1333,Female,Train," Wait, is this just a bill to promote filtering and to say that you need to, that it's something that we hear a lot when people are talking about, they want to see comprehensive"
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0181.wav,X,3.8,3.2,4.2,1334,Female,Train," No, really, the thing that they're unhappy about is that platforms are exerting their First Amendment."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0193.wav,X,3.0,5.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train," In that case, the actual question of can the intermediaries technically comply with what the law is."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0197.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train, Right to say no nudity or no pornography.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0205.wav,X,5.0,4.0,4.0,1333,Female,Train, That's a kind of incentive in the law for companies to be really overbroad in taking down protected speech that the Supreme Court has already said it has major First Amendment.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0210.wav,X,3.0,3.0,5.0,1334,Female,Train," But there's some significant constitutional questions, and we see this in the copyright context about whether they are."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0211.wav,X,4.0,3.0,3.0,1334,Female,Train, That's actually okay or whether that's actually representing a due process.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0219.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.0,1334,Female,Train, said and whether there's a viable claim that could even result in five thousand dollars damages.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0290.wav,X,3.4,4.8,5.0,1333,Female,Train, Creating a lot of different carveouts for existing section two hundred and thirty protection.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0296.wav,X,3.6,3.2,3.4,1333,Female,Train, My best read of these proposals is that they might actually require changes to existing federal criminal law as well as the two hundred and thirty framework.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0298.wav,X,3.0,5.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train, He also talks about or the DRJ proposal also talks about creating a kind of notice and take down system.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0300.wav,X,3.2,4.8,3.2,1333,Female,Train, What kind of illegal or how illegal the content at issue might be.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0331.wav,X,3.0,5.0,4.0,1334,Female,Train, So in some sense it does connect.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0342.wav,X,4.0,5.0,4.0,1334,Female,Train, speech and they're basically I
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0344.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.0,1334,Female,Train, platforms being able to facilitate anonymous speech where the idea is you don't let anybody speak unless you have a way of holding them accountable.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0345.wav,X,4.0,5.0,3.0,1334,Female,Train," That's not consistent, I think, with the way the First Amendment articulates that right."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0348.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.0,480,Male,Train, We also see constitutional issues.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0353.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.0,1334,Female,Train," introductory flowy language. I mean, there's just so many misconceptions that are informing the policy recommendation. There was one section I saw where they were talking about how section two hundred and thirty got passed."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0415.wav,X,4.0,5.0,5.0,1334,Female,Train," I really don't understand quite how these political decisions are being made, where they're."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0434.wav,X,5.0,4.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train," I mean, one thing I thought was interesting reading the DOJ report for the rhetoric."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0438.wav,X,3.0,3.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train, And it pulls on different things that those of us in the advocacy world have been saying for years about wanting more transparency from companies about what their policies are and how.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0448.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.0,1333,Female,Train," It's hard to tell exactly what it is they're doing, but it sounds good if you start."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0455.wav,X,5.0,4.0,5.0,1334,Female,Train, It is very I'm very cynical about the rhetoric there.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0484.wav,X,4.0,3.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train, What I think this proposal from DOJ is trying to do is really change that and say that no.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0492.wav,X,4.0,3.0,5.0,1333,Female,Train, government couldn't mandate. So that itself is it's one of those things.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0529.wav,X,4.0,4.0,3.0,1333,Female,Train, kind of reinvigorate it. And we're seeing a lot of focus in the kind of political discussion about section two hundred and thirty on C two.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0556.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.0,1333,Female,Train," It's not really clear what that means, at least to me in reading this report."
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0559.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.0,1333,Female,Train, do mean various pieces of these proposals to be read together. So changes that they propose.
MSP-PODCAST_2395_0575.wav,X,3.0,5.0,3.0,1334,Female,Train, No gain and nothing but loss. And I think they should be a lot more intellectually honest about.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0024.wav,X,3.0,3.0,5.0,1329,Female,Train," You know, there are arguments about how much"
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0040.wav,X,5.0,3.0,4.0,1329,Female,Train," trust or foundation or something created with the money, but it certainly"
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0046_0005.wav,X,4.2,3.4,4.0,1610,Male,Train," Great. Well, well, I'm glad we were able to to"
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0062.wav,X,3.0,4.0,5.0,1329,Female,Train, activity and for anybody who's interested partners in health.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0067.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.0,1329,Female,Train," For whatever reason, someone shows up and they're sick."
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0068.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.0,1329,Female,Train," So, and they're infectious. So you ask them, well, gee, we."
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0086.wav,X,5.0,5.0,3.0,1329,Female,Train," You know, ideally it's done by people in your community who know you and know the other people and"
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0104.wav,X,4.0,3.0,5.0,480,Male,Train, Society. It's an interesting way to think of it that I think a lot of people maybe don't in that the idea of contact tracing is a form of contact.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0118.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.0,1329,Female,Train," And people who've been doing this on a broad scale, you know, what is it people are searching for? Are they searching for loss of smell? Oh, that person."
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0126.wav,X,3.0,4.0,5.0,1329,Female,Train, They've tried it in Singapore and I think.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0130.wav,X,3.2,3.2,4.8,1329,Female,Train, So one is will people use it and.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0137.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.0,1329,Female,Train," Am I going to change my behavior or think, well, you know,"
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0183.wav,X,4.0,3.0,3.0,1329,Female,Train, Yeah. And this is just one more kind of
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0192.wav,X,3.666667,4.833333,4.333333,480,Male,Train," And to build on that can potentially lead to something that is much more powerful and is, you know, really useful."
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0203.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.0,1329,Female,Train," You know, one question I have is, is it designed"
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0204.wav,X,4.0,5.0,5.0,1329,Female,Train, And Apple and Google will probably tell you that's in the app. It's not part of our protocol.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0207.wav,X,2.166667,4.166667,2.5,1329,Female,Train, Because that's the only person I've sat next to in the last day and I wasn't on the bus or in the grocery. Mary must be sick. And is that a feature or a bug?
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0208.wav,X,5.333333,3.666667,4.5,1329,Female,Train," But I know if I do get sick, it was Mary. Right. And you know, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I me"
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0221.wav,X,5.0,3.0,3.0,1329,Female,Train," You know, all these questions are unanswered."
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0225.wav,X,4.0,3.0,5.0,1329,Female,Train," One, you go get care, but two."
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0314.wav,X,2.5,4.0,2.5,1329,Female,Train," I mean, it's easy to find scandals and."
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0319.wav,X,5.0,5.0,4.0,1329,Female,Train, We don't have the resources is not because they were necessarily.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0324.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.2,1329,Female,Train, I don't I don't wanna preach but you know it's become
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0343.wav,X,4.6,3.0,3.0,480,Male,Train," You know, as as we've said, you know, it there there's a lot of"
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0359.wav,X,4.0,3.166667,3.166667,1329,Female,Train, But there's a point.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0362.wav,X,2.333333,3.166667,2.333333,1329,Female,Train, A couple of things happen. You.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0378.wav,X,4.0,4.0,5.0,1329,Female,Train, Just get enough grants so that we can run a program for.
MSP-PODCAST_2396_0390.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.0,1329,Female,Train, And it looks forward towards the future and starts investing instead of just spending.
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0006.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.0,480,Male,Train," It does not normally run to forty minutes. Either way, this was a fun discussion on the ins and outs of Section two hundred and thirty and the details of Trump's executive order. Enjoy."
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0014.wav,X,5.0,3.0,5.0,1328,Female,Train, including an explainer on the evolution of section two hundred and thirty and all the key nuances of the debates around it and content moderation to understand. My special guest.
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0016.wav,X,4.0,3.0,5.0,1328,Female,Train," He also, by the way, recently launched a new section dedicated to tech and COVID coverage, as well as a new forum with different voices called the greenhouse, which focuses on tricky tech topics and."
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0041.wav,X,5.5,5.0,4.0,1328,Female,Train," on a recipe swap site, whether it's sharing photos of family and friends, whether it's posting a car for sale, there's so many layers."
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0042.wav,X,4.0,3.0,4.0,1328,Female,Train," to this. It has allowed the modern internet to thrive. One of the best lines I heard, I think this is actually in verge, is that in a many ways."
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0045.wav,X,5.0,5.0,3.0,480,Male,Train," set up, there would be much more limited ability for users to actually post content online. And it's a little bit crazy to me that people"
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0052.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.0,480,Male,Train, They are now a platform and therefore they lose section two hundred and thirty protection. The law makes no distinction between platform and publisher. The law is not designed.
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0073.wav,X,5.0,5.0,4.0,480,Male,Train," That particular line is from Twitter itself and therefore is not protected by two hundred and thirty, but is completely protected by the First Amendment, the third party content that."
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0088.wav,X,4.0,4.0,3.0,480,Male,Train," make of the phone and common carrier type argument. Yeah, so it's an important one to understand, but I don't think it applies. And I think that most people who are deeply"
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0089.wav,X,5.0,5.0,3.0,480,Male,Train," familiar with public utilities and what is required to be declared a public utility would recognize that internet services, what's sometimes called edge providers, which are the services that you and I use every day."
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0090.wav,X,4.0,3.0,4.0,480,Male,Train," every day that we interact with, that they do not qualify and they do not meet the requirements of a typical traditional utility service. And to clarify what's"
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0132.wav,X,5.8,3.2,5.0,480,Male,Train, is totally at odds with both what is written in the law and what twenty years of case law have said. And that's worrisome only to the extent.
MSP-PODCAST_2397_0154.wav,X,5.0,3.0,4.0,480,Male,Train, Yet the executive order suggests that the FCC should look into whether or not that interpretation makes sense. So you're basically saying that the two provisions of CDA two hundred thirty.

MSP-PODCAST_2441_0025.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.2,1454,Female,Train, We really wanted to work with students who were interested in a variety of different social issues. And the goal was to help them see how they
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0038.wav,X,3.2,4.6,4.2,1454,Female,Train, It really had a lot of potential for growth beyond just that first two week session.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0039.wav,X,3.4,4.2,3.4,1450,Female,Train," And I know in your place it has grown a lot, but also."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0044.wav,X,5.4,5.2,4.6,1453,Female,Train," Something that would be something I could do across my department from grade six to ten. And also, we've got this, those of you are familiar with the IBDP and the IBMYP program."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0050.wav,X,4.4,5.8,3.8,1453,Female,Train," They find out about themselves and they find about their world and they're not even finding, they're making sense of it for the first time as teenagers and they're so passionate and they're so sincere."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0055.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.6,1453,Female,Train," country where it has many problems and where advocacy is not always the safest way forward, then how do you negotiate? How do you make sure that the children?"
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0063.wav,X,5.0,4.8,4.6,1453,Female,Train," Some of the advocate, when we, you know, we didn't like Brynne just mentioned, she opened it up to sixteen students and I'm sure that the educators are putting in a lot of effort and I remember she told me."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0081.wav,X,5.6,4.6,5.8,1453,Female,Train," You jump into such things. You do come across children. A lot of our children are actually doing research. They're picking up a lot of media. And so my concern was that when they looked at gender empowerment, the me too movement."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0082.wav,X,4.4,3.6,5.2,1453,Female,Train, was flourishing at that time. A lot of children came up with a lot of texts and which I found was so influenced by social media.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0108.wav,X,4.6,4.8,4.8,1454,Female,Train," I mean, it makes the work so much more meaningful. It honors the students who are coming in and really lets us, like as educators, work with them as partners."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0111.wav,X,3.6,4.4,4.2,1454,Female,Train, And it really matters. It's very important for students to grow up knowing that they have important things to say and to know how to have.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0124.wav,X,4.0,4.4,3.8,1453,Female,Train," It has just struck us and so we were like, okay, this is the best time to do it."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0125.wav,X,5.4,5.2,5.8,1453,Female,Train, Ready to focus and hone in. So I was already doing this with my MYP and my teachers. And so I took this up with my DP star.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0127.wav,X,5.0,4.2,4.4,1453,Female,Train," To put work up, then the question of, okay, miss, do we put this, do we publish this, do we not publish this? And so I just realized how freedom of speech."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0132.wav,X,5.6,4.6,4.4,1453,Female,Train," And so I said, okay, we're going to give permission to all our students to advocate whatever they want. And you know, the moment you say that, again, you know."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0135.wav,X,4.6,3.8,5.0,1453,Female,Train," lessons to teach you. And I think that is why it has been such a bittersweet affair, like I said, that you learn so many lessons of what you cannot do."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0142.wav,X,4.2,5.0,4.4,1453,Female,Train," Look, I think some of the successes are this, that the one thing that comes out of getting involved in, I was mentioning, I was really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,"
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0145.wav,X,5.4,5.2,5.8,1453,Female,Train, Think about how it could be if you were advocating through art and literature. And so we came across this idea of ad book creation.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0150.wav,X,4.8,4.2,4.8,1453,Female,Train," A personal achievement goal or a personal growth for me. Apart from this, I think my whole department, we as a team are still and are going to do rise up and ride every day."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0157.wav,X,4.4,5.0,5.0,1450,Female,Train, Magic beans for you. Where did this? How did you get started with Rise Up and Rain?
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0161.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.6,1454,Female,Train, Funding allowed me to take time to learn more about writing an advocacy work and what that looks like.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0176.wav,X,5.2,3.6,5.4,1454,Female,Train," Full of, I'm sure, amazing ideas, but it takes more than that to really know and do this work. And so I shared a bunch of Google folders with Sadaf, but we also kept talking."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0178.wav,X,2.8,4.6,4.4,1454,Female,Train, I think the reality of work like this is that we want to see it grow. And so I want to share it widely and help.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0179.wav,X,5.6,5.6,5.0,1454,Female,Train, Continue creating new ideas and new frameworks and new opportunities for young people to learn to write in these ways.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0183.wav,X,5.4,4.4,5.4,1453,Female,Train," The research, the layout and the framework of the whole curriculum that she's designed, it really is something that I think over the years we're going to be, you know,"
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0190.wav,X,5.4,5.2,5.0,1454,Female,Train," I was like, I don't know what's gonna happen. Like, let's have a great summer camp. Let's have fun time. Let's write some stuff."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0213.wav,X,5.0,4.4,4.8,1454,Female,Train, and learn about each other's places and work. So we're really hopeful that we have a good proposal for that grant application and hope that we can build some.
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0214.wav,X,5.2,4.6,4.6,1454,Female,Train," Something even bigger moving forward. So that's what we're working on in Madison. What's next for you, Sadaf?"
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0216.wav,X,5.0,4.8,4.6,1453,Female,Train," process or in the kind of or trained, I haven't even we haven't trained in the way that perhaps we would make us more effective."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0222.wav,X,4.2,3.8,3.8,1453,Female,Train," It has a plan of its own. And I think that is what is important that whatever you're investing in, is it worth it? Is it important? And I think."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0227.wav,X,3.8,4.4,4.0,1454,Female,Train," And sharing things. So it's really no different than working with, you know, teachers who live down the road, as it is working with Saddafi."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0237.wav,X,5.0,4.8,5.2,1453,Female,Train," That whenever I found those people, it makes me find out, coming back to what we want the kids to find out, it makes me find out more about myself."
MSP-PODCAST_2441_0248.wav,X,4.4,5.2,4.6,1454,Female,Train, And so the people who are passionate and excited about this and want to come in and try it out and help you learn and see it grow and then take it into their.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0013.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.8,1458,Female,Train," We've been reading your stuff. You've been writing on your personal blog, the rewrite blog, and of course also posted to write now and raise these questions. So you've been thinking about it."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0015.wav,X,4.8,4.8,4.8,1458,Female,Train, Facing online teaching for the first time. So let's start with you. Would you talk about what you've been thinking about this summer and kind of?
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0018.wav,X,3.4,4.6,4.4,1455,Male,Train, That happened in the spring six months into me having these classes. I've been with those students for six months. We already had a strong community. We already had strong connections.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0026.wav,X,4.6,4.8,4.8,1455,Male,Train," community and those connections and having a space where the students can be vulnerable and take risks and having their, you know, that they want to, you know, read my feedback."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0027.wav,X,4.8,4.2,4.6,1455,Male,Train, feedback because they know me and they can kind of hear me in it. That's so critical to the and that's something that I learned from the writing project itself.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0031.wav,X,4.0,4.4,3.8,1455,Male,Train, How do you build community? How do you get them talking to each other? How do you have a discussion? And it's been really fun.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0033.wav,X,3.6,3.4,3.4,1455,Male,Train, Amazing educators from across the country and the world. And it's just been a delight. So that's kind of what the vlog has been up to.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0045.wav,X,4.0,3.4,3.8,1456,Female,Train, So that's a part of a practice that they would want to develop anyway is noticing interesting thinking and kids work and how do you do that?
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0052.wav,X,4.0,5.0,4.4,1456,Female,Train," And we're going to build community that way, while you having some agency. I know how crucial it is, and Matt, I know you know this because I've read enough of your blog."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0057.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.2,1456,Female,Train, I thought they might feel interesting based on their reading practices or immediately engaging.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0058.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.0,1456,Female,Train," And the other thing I ask of them is if we say this over and over again, is read one, respond to one."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0061.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.0,1456,Female,Train," I'm from that town too, or I also played soccer for ten years, or whatever the thing is they have in common. L only takes a few times of that happening where they."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0064.wav,X,2.8,3.8,3.0,1456,Female,Train," And then we start doing a very writing project thing where I'm asking them to notice golden lines in each other's writing, so favorite sounds."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0066.wav,X,4.6,4.8,4.6,1456,Female,Train, to a few students and talk about their questions or their golden lines so that they're immediately hearing their names and seeing themselves seen and heard.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0070.wav,X,4.6,3.8,4.4,1456,Female,Train," And so they read their colleagues work and they amplify and highlight interesting ideas from our class. And I do that a couple of ways. Some semesters, they just."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0072.wav,X,3.8,4.8,4.8,1456,Female,Train, Great. And we post those on our site. Other times I have them write a more formal blog where they not only highlight the work of their.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0073.wav,X,4.4,5.2,4.4,1456,Female,Train," peers, but they also explain to a public what we've been thinking about in our class. So they're in charge of curation curating the interesting ideas that came out of our class."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0079.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.4,1456,Female,Train," They'll say, oh, they got noticed last week. We need to look at a different one. They're really good about that. So those are some of the ways that I try to."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0083.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.2,1456,Female,Train, Just holding like a zoom session with a few of them to meet and just talk. It takes ten or fifteen minutes for us to just
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0088.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.8,1458,Female,Train," It strikes me too as the, in some ways, the way you described it, there's so much advice that says, you know, go slow at the beginning."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0089.wav,X,4.6,5.2,5.0,1458,Female,Train," To get the system set up and help people understand them. And then it's going to speed up. You are going to get there, but invest in the building of the structures."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0093.wav,X,4.4,4.6,4.4,1456,Female,Train," So where I might have that feel like that's happening within week three or something of a face to face class, four or five is more, you know, it's."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0102.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.6,1457,Female,Train," At the same time, like we were just talking about."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0109.wav,X,5.0,5.4,5.0,1457,Female,Train, Where we have learned some things about how people learn at incredible distances and learn in these peer to peer to peer to peer relationships.

MSP-PODCAST_2442_0125.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.4,1457,Female,Train, And it was so it was frequent enough. So it just got me thinking about what we already know about how connecting it is to create things.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0131.wav,X,5.2,5.4,5.2,1457,Female,Train," Add on and build to. So it got me thinking about what if a classroom had, you could create something, but you could also submit it to be remade."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0141.wav,X,4.8,5.0,4.4,1458,Female,Train," that put the young people, the students or our colleagues, if it's with adults, in a leadership role of curating and creating knowledge as well."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0144.wav,X,3.8,3.8,3.4,1455,Male,Train," But no, I mean, what's fun is there's actually a lot of things that Kim and I are talking about are very similar to."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0148.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.4,1455,Male,Train, And that's if you're like grading papers all night every night with one hundred and sixty students like I have. And so like the idea that like you can have students.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0151.wav,X,5.0,4.4,4.8,1455,Male,Train," It's like, you would never think of like a basketball coach. You'd be like, I watched your game. I'll get back to you in a month. Right? It's like, no, they're doing these."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0152.wav,X,5.0,4.4,4.8,1455,Male,Train," Little things in practice, they watch layup drills or focus on something and then, you know, they kind of do this quick thing or a quick, you know."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0153.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.6,1455,Male,Train," Passing drill and then they give them feedback on it. And then yeah, they do get feedback on the game too."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0157.wav,X,4.6,5.0,4.6,1455,Male,Train," This thing of two way street where it's like, how are you? Like one of the questions I was going to ask is just like,"
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0158.wav,X,4.6,4.4,4.6,1455,Male,Train," What is your learning environment like? Just tell me about it, you know, because it's going to, that's going to be really important. And you know, for me, it's going to be traditional."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0163.wav,X,4.8,4.4,4.4,1455,Male,Train," Community like we can, you know, especially if you're a veteran teacher, you can kind of walk around the class, you know, at the beginning, at the end of class, you can."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0164.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.0,1455,Male,Train, Check in. You can get all these moments that help to sort of build community. You can kind of sit there at the center and ask kids questions.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0165.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.8,1455,Male,Train, There's a teacher named Matt Kaye out of Philadelphia who wrote a wonderful book called Not Light but Fire. And he talks about that. See how he just starts everything.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0171.wav,X,4.6,4.8,4.6,1455,Male,Train," And do all this great stuff. So, you know, I think this has been both wonderfully illuminating and, you know, also, you know, kind of validating of where I'm going. So, you know, I'm not going to be able to do that."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0173.wav,X,5.8,5.6,5.4,1458,Female,Train," Also, a point that we could bring up. There's feedback in the sense of what I notice you're doing and let's help make that better, the kind of thing you might want to do on."
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0191.wav,X,4.0,4.6,4.8,1457,Female,Train, Redo this. One of these weeks we're going to So I've been thinking about what could I have them create together?

MSP-PODCAST_2442_0199.wav,X,3.2,4.4,4.4,1458,Female,Train, You're chatting. And you sort of hear and learn because we talk while we make in a way that we would never just speak things that we're not.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0201.wav,X,4.0,4.0,3.6,1455,Male,Train, I think that this notion of creation together and play together and silly conversation here and there together is going to be super important. I've been thinking about that.
MSP-PODCAST_2442_0202.wav,X,4.4,4.6,4.6,1455,Male,Train," That a lot. How like, you know, that's a normal part of school. And if it's just kind of go in here are the directions, go off and zoom, do your thing, you know."

MSP-PODCAST_2442_0252.wav,X,4.8,4.4,4.2,1455,Male,Train," The real stuff that you learn from the reading and the writing when they're doing it, not just because we say something doesn't mean that they know it."

MSP-PODCAST_2446_0003.wav,X,5.4,4.4,5.0,1466,Female,Train," We know from that experience that a co lab is a working session where in effect we take up a problem, we hear from somebody who's going to give us some thinking and then."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0009.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.6,1466,Female,Train," pre pandemic. So this is not new to her, and we're going to be hearing from her some of the ways she thinks about planning for a teaching and also in a way that is more"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0011.wav,X,4.0,3.8,4.0,1466,Female,Train, Great to have you with us. We are going to start with introductions from our teacher consultants. You'll see some of the crew are back for a second login.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0012.wav,X,4.2,4.4,4.6,1466,Female,Train," This time. So we're going to go around and hear first from the teachers what they're thinking about so that you can hear that too, Dina. And then we're going to turn it over."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0015.wav,X,4.4,5.2,4.4,1468,Male,Train, It's super great. So I recorded myself reading a short story for my students in sixth grade with the voices and the pauses and the whole thing and I inserted.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0016.wav,X,5.0,4.2,4.8,1468,Male,Train, Questions during it and I explained it to the students. We made the accounts and let them finish it. I gave them until I gave them two.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0018.wav,X,4.6,5.0,5.0,1468,Male,Train, I'll be able to add to the tool belt this year. So I'm excited.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0024.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.2,1469,Female,Train, to go back and they pushed it back a week. So Monday I will have students in the room. We've been meeting as teachers though.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0027.wav,X,4.4,5.0,4.8,1470,Male,Train, Figure out how the planning is going to look and then one hundred percent virtual learning.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0034.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.0,1467,Female,Train, I just wanted to share very quickly that my teaching context for the fall will be a mixture of online and hybrid classes.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0038.wav,X,5.0,5.2,4.8,1467,Female,Train, She has some rules that I actually thought were pretty useful as a thinking tool that helped me sort through.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0041.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.4,1467,Female,Train, So I wanted to just briefly touch on hyperdocs and why I love them. I've included some links to some of them.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0050.wav,X,5.4,4.6,4.8,1467,Female,Train, So I have templates for my units and they will be the same for every unit throughout the semester. We have a plan for each week. We will follow the same.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0053.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.2,1467,Female,Train, So you can read those blog posts. I also included this little graphic that explains what a hyperdoc is and is not. Just as a quick.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0054.wav,X,5.2,5.2,5.4,1467,Female,Train, kind of thinking tool to remind you that it's not just a digital version of a worksheet that it's actually a lot more.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0055.wav,X,5.2,5.0,5.2,1467,Female,Train, There's also some thinking that I hope will be helpful for those of you who are newer to online or blended learning.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0063.wav,X,3.0,2.8,3.2,1467,Female,Train, How things look and work differently now.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0064.wav,X,4.8,3.8,4.2,1467,Female,Train," But the key is that everything online takes longer. It takes longer to learn things, it takes longer to do things, it takes longer to explain things."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0066.wav,X,4.2,2.6,5.2,1467,Female,Train," The better you are as you approach things. You know, never forget that all of us are in cognitive overload, you know, or on the verge of it at any given time."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0067.wav,X,4.8,5.0,4.6,1467,Female,Train," Oh, and I did want to mention one other thing about the hyperdocs before we moved on. The hyperdoc community is amazing and wonderful and generous."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0081.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.6,1467,Female,Train," But now my pandemic template model is much more based on this explore, explain, apply model."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0083.wav,X,4.0,4.0,3.6,1467,Female,Train, One of these templates.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0084.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.4,1467,Female,Train, Because I just think it's a really fun one based on the hero's journey.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0086.wav,X,4.2,3.6,3.8,1467,Female,Train, Get this out of the way where you start with a call to adventure where you're just basically engaging them in some way. Then you do some exploration where they.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0087.wav,X,4.6,4.6,4.4,1467,Female,Train," enter the unknown. Then you bring in a mentor and that mentor could be a video, it could be a mentor text of some sort, or it could be some sort of a mentor."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0088.wav,X,4.8,5.4,4.8,1467,Female,Train," Something that you do to engage them further. In fact, it mentions Ed Puzzle right there. Did you see that?"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0090.wav,X,3.8,2.8,3.4,1467,Female,Train, focus on some type of assessment or reflection or some combination thereof.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0092.wav,X,4.4,3.6,4.8,1467,Female,Train," worksheet, which a lot of my templates look that way as well. But I have seen people do game boards using Google Slides. I have people."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0093.wav,X,4.6,4.4,4.2,1467,Female,Train, Doing more of a choose your own adventure using a Google site. I have seen people use Google forms so that they can collect information from students in little doses all the way.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0100.wav,X,3.6,3.8,4.2,1467,Female,Train," So I have given them two reasons. One, we're going to be building our community, learning more about each other."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0102.wav,X,4.4,3.8,5.2,1467,Female,Train, Working on also because this is a very simple task that we're involved in my third benefit is that they're going to be learning.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0126.wav,X,5.2,5.0,4.4,1467,Female,Train," So that you are not involved in this process, that you can then direct students down to a certain path that can be very interactive."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0133.wav,X,3.8,3.6,3.4,1467,Female,Train," So the more of that, I mean, I certainly will be in there. And especially this first time, you know, these first couple of weeks as we're learning how to do this, I'll be in there supporting."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0135.wav,X,3.4,4.4,3.8,1467,Female,Train," If somebody's made a mistake, I can help fix that easily, which is another glorious thing about using Google Docs. It's really easy to fix a mistake if somebody's made a mistake."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0144.wav,X,5.6,4.4,5.6,1467,Female,Train," I shifted a lot of our interaction online because so much of my face to face classroom would have been pair and share, turn and talk, small."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0150.wav,X,5.0,4.2,4.6,1467,Female,Train," do the things that you want it to do. And then she spends a lot of time, like you need to think about the order that's important to you."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0152.wav,X,4.8,3.6,3.8,1467,Female,Train," Okay, I don't have to change my units. That'll still fit within the time period that we have."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0153.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.2,1467,Female,Train, And then I spend a lot of time really thinking about how I wanted the cycle of my week to work because I knew what I did in the before time.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0160.wav,X,3.6,3.6,3.2,1467,Female,Train, And that those buckets don't get too full.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0165.wav,X,4.4,3.0,4.2,1467,Female,Train," I don't spend a lot of time. I mean, I know I did at the top of this unit. I gave them a definition because I wanted to have I wanted them to have a working definition."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0166.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.4,1467,Female,Train," that we all agreed on for values. But sometimes when we're learning new material, I give them a lot of resources and then I make them collaborate on their definitions."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0167.wav,X,3.6,4.2,4.0,1467,Female,Train," And their descriptions and their tips, I send them forth in the world to find examples and models. So they're developing those resources as a team, working together."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0168.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.4,1467,Female,Train," And that is one of the great powerful things, I think. It takes so much weight off of me. It makes that engagement real."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0169.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.2,1467,Female,Train, And active for them. And they own that and they'll remember it a lot longer than if I had just given it to them.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0172.wav,X,4.2,5.0,4.2,1467,Female,Train," And so that's the beautiful thing, you know, like I could for this activity, I can, you know, the posting of their snaps, check, you know, their interaction with this."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0174.wav,X,4.8,4.8,4.4,1467,Female,Train, There's a lot of different ways that you can do that that don't require a lot from you.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0176.wav,X,4.6,4.6,4.6,1467,Female,Train," So that you know like, oh, I guess I may need to, you know, go back over this, or you can do a just in time intervention as your wife."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0178.wav,X,5.6,4.8,5.8,1467,Female,Train," And also, I think, especially, this is really important at this time, it makes it really easy for makeup work that if they miss that week, even."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0184.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.6,1467,Female,Train," But I would say the method that I'm using this semester is actually what you would describe as a high flex method, which gives the students a lot more discretion over the path that they are choosing to."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0203.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.4,1470,Male,Train," The two columns there, notice that you had options. You had option one and option two. And I guess, do you explain that to the students?"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0219.wav,X,5.4,4.6,5.6,1467,Female,Train," Easily editable, you could always say after the first semester, well, that bombed. I think we'll take that off class and not have that. That didn't work. Or maybe it does work."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0225.wav,X,5.0,5.0,5.0,1468,Male,Train," One is what would you say to teachers who in terms of like, you know, table setting, like talking to students about like setting up your Google?"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0226.wav,X,4.8,4.6,5.4,1468,Male,Train," You know, this is what you click on and here's how you share it and doing all that, which might seem like super frustrating to some teachers and they're like, ah, it's not worth it."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0227.wav,X,3.6,3.6,3.6,1468,Male,Train," And then my second question is when you were talking about interaction, like when the kids were looking at the snaps, like what does that?"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0228.wav,X,4.6,4.4,4.4,1468,Male,Train, What is that and how do you hold them accountable for the interaction?
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0229.wav,X,5.0,4.4,4.0,1467,Female,Train," So the first part, they start the semester, that one of the first things I give them is an orientation, which is just a Google slideshow. But it is like."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0233.wav,X,5.0,4.2,4.4,1467,Female,Train," like bookmarket or whatever, you know, because they don't want to save it because you want to have it so that like it shows when I change things. So I mentioned that like multiple times."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0235.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.8,1467,Female,Train," You know, the syllabus, but also through the orientation, I take them through a version of what I showed you guys. So this is what the unit document looks like."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0248.wav,X,4.4,5.0,5.2,1466,Female,Train, Down the road without having to do that for a new tool or a new process for every unit.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0259.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.8,1469,Female,Train," spot interacting together, you know, addressing the problems as they arise. So when you have these students who are, they're still interacting, it's just"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0265.wav,X,3.8,4.4,3.6,1467,Female,Train," exploring and then brainstorming, then planning, then drafting, then workshopping, then their final reflection that leads to their grade."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0266.wav,X,4.2,3.4,4.0,1467,Female,Train," And so, so that, you know, they should be somewhat on that same process together. You know, their timeline might not look exactly the same as everybody. I mean, there's going to be."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0274.wav,X,3.4,4.2,4.0,1467,Female,Train," But also, it has repercussions because the community, because we all benefit from those ideas as well as that feedback and inspiration."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0278.wav,X,4.8,5.2,5.2,1469,Female,Train," I like the idea of giving them kind of that soft guideline, so you know, it teaches them that time management, that responsibility."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0289.wav,X,4.6,4.4,5.0,1466,Female,Train, State do this and that's why that kind of thing. That transparency seems really a key here.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0295.wav,X,4.0,4.2,4.0,1467,Female,Train," This was my thing that I wouldn't have tried. Or I love how, you know, Martin struggled and like failed like three times, but he kept working at it and like, man, he got it."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0297.wav,X,3.6,4.0,3.6,1467,Female,Train, I cry sometimes when I read those badges.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0299.wav,X,4.4,5.0,5.2,1466,Female,Train, fifth graders and similarly used badges in the community. We'll link that as one of the resources for people that are watching this. But I'm wondering.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0314.wav,X,4.2,3.4,3.6,1470,Male,Train," me of kind of what Mike said last time, you know, we can't see everything going on when when we do the breakouts or whatever, so that kind of allows."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0316.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.2,1468,Male,Train," I was going to ask a quick question about for teachers who are really curious about starting this process, would you suggest that they convert one unit first or just go?"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0332.wav,X,4.0,3.8,3.8,1467,Female,Train, So I would say minimal tools and start as you mean to go on and don't try to do too many things. Like there are a lot of nifty tools out there.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0335.wav,X,4.8,5.0,4.4,1467,Female,Train," Like one of the things that, you know, of course, she's famous for this, right, is you take the object and you're like, does it bring me joy? And if it doesn't, you throw it away."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0337.wav,X,4.6,3.8,4.6,1467,Female,Train, Like there's a lot of procedures sometimes that I have built in assignments and it was in response to a specific problem at that time.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0338.wav,X,5.2,4.2,4.8,1467,Female,Train," And I just kept doing it. And like maybe that problem doesn't apply anymore, especially under our new circumstances. So I think it's really worthwhile going through and taking things up and saying."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0350.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.8,1467,Female,Train, Although I'm assuming most of them probably can build a Google slide pretty easily without my intervention.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0355.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.4,1466,Female,Train," in the best sense, low stakes product in effect. And so to learn the processes and the procedures with low stakes"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0359.wav,X,3.6,4.2,4.4,1466,Female,Train," products through that same process is it seems to me that was demonstrated in the unit that you gave us, which feels like a good thing."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0361.wav,X,3.8,4.0,4.4,1466,Female,Train," Could also, you mentioned I would start with an activity, what David, you said, where would you start? You said with an activity, but it could be that there's a kind of recurring"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0369.wav,X,4.4,4.0,4.4,1468,Male,Train," You can cluster, you can make a list, you can free write. Cool. Next, here's my first draft. Don't worry about punctuation stuff. Just get it out on your page."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0373.wav,X,4.8,4.6,5.4,1467,Female,Train," Discuss as a group what our standards are going to be for that particular deliverable. And there's a process that I take them through. So that's like once we have that in a hyperdoc, then we just follow that."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0378.wav,X,5.4,5.2,5.0,1467,Female,Train," So that has always been a reflection that they prepared for me, but this semester, I'm having them do weekly reflections. And so that's part of our weekly work."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0381.wav,X,5.0,4.2,4.2,1467,Female,Train," Hopefully I don't die of work, but I don't think I will because it's kind of fun and it's not terribly time consuming and it's very low stakes."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0386.wav,X,4.4,3.8,4.4,1466,Female,Train," You're going to see the links and you'll get a link to the, you'll be able to get the slideshow that has links to a number of blog posts."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0387.wav,X,5.2,4.2,5.0,1466,Female,Train," posts that explain things further. If at any point you want to give us some of those examples of like your Google Doc or whatever, I'm thinking Ben's like, I want"
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0400.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.8,1469,Female,Train, It'll be great. So I'm definitely gonna try adapting one of my activities with that.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0404.wav,X,3.8,5.0,4.6,1468,Male,Train," It's like no, it's like click, listen, interface. And so Diana, thank you so much. I'm looking forward to trying all these cool ideas out."
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0409.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.2,1467,Female,Train, And I was going to add so one of my friends and one of my writing project leaders teaches seventh grade and so her district has kind of.
MSP-PODCAST_2446_0411.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.6,1467,Female,Train, together is that her students in both groups can interact on those documents together so that they can still.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0006.wav,X,4.2,5.2,4.2,1450,Female,Train," Thank Penguin Random House for putting Candice's book in our hands. And as you know, Brian, we were so excited that after we read the book, the first thing we said is we know who would be the."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0010.wav,X,4.4,5.0,4.8,1450,Female,Train, I would like to tell everybody about Candace.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0020.wav,X,4.6,3.8,3.8,1471,Male,Train," And was featured in the book Continuing the Journey, becoming a better teacher of literature and informational text. She also is a former former, excuse me, state coordinator of NCTEs and guests."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0024.wav,X,3.8,4.4,4.4,1473,Female,Train, To you and Tanya and Penguin and the National Riding Project for this opportunity. I am beyond excited. I'm trying to contain myself because I've also been stalking candies.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0035.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.6,1450,Female,Train, I have maybe already talked to you about this because it was a very surprising joy in my.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0037.wav,X,3.6,3.6,3.6,1450,Female,Train," So I have spent most of my life. I maybe I watched the movie The Birds too young, but spent most of my life really afraid of birds. And like, I just."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0041.wav,X,4.6,5.0,4.4,1450,Female,Train, Many of them had babies in the nest.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0042.wav,X,3.6,4.6,3.6,1450,Female,Train," And I suddenly became very interested and enamored of them. And so we have crows, and then we had some."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0074.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.6,1473,Female,Train," Okay, okay. But yeah, so I just enjoyed reading her story and definitely saw a lot of myself through the story. And so I'm just gonna go ahead and mine."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0081.wav,X,2.8,4.0,3.8,1472,Female,Train," I wanted to go back and forth between present day main character and who she was as a child, and so that the reader could make connections."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0082.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.4,1472,Female,Train," And so in order for me to do that kind of in a way that made sense and that was enjoyable for the reader and not too confusing, verse just seemed very nice."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0084.wav,X,5.6,5.0,4.6,1473,Female,Train," I think you did a superb job in doing that because like you like you mentioned, you know, you don't want to confuse the reader, but it's just so action passed."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0090.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.4,1473,Female,Train," From the beginning, you know, start off with this huge milestone and it just kind of takes off from there. And so like I said, it really resonated with me."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0092.wav,X,5.2,4.8,4.6,1473,Female,Train," to add to that question, I'm going to move on to the next one. And I would like to know, this is something I've been thinking and thinking and thinking about."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0099.wav,X,4.0,4.2,4.4,1472,Female,Train, I was going to get frustrated with the fact that most people were not going to pronounce it correctly.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0104.wav,X,5.2,4.8,4.4,1472,Female,Train, Just like kind of like what you go through when you're writing a book. I had several like rounds and drafts of things that sounded like titles that would work.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0107.wav,X,3.6,3.8,3.4,1472,Female,Train," It just, it points directly to the heart of the story, which is."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0112.wav,X,2.6,3.0,3.2,1472,Female,Train, Watching us. And so there were some other titles that were competing with this.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0121.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.4,1473,Female,Train, of writing this novel and ensuring the flow between the chapters. So you kind of mentioned why you chose the novel in verse and how you kind of went back and forth.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0130.wav,X,4.6,4.6,5.2,1472,Female,Train," Like, you know, you have an experience and then your brain pulls up a memory that reminds you that, you know, that you're reminded of suddenly. And so like, you know, you"
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0136.wav,X,5.0,4.6,4.2,1472,Female,Train," I'm thinking about being evocative with the sound, but I'm also thinking about like, what does our brain really do when we're having life experiences? And like, how can I tell this?"
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0146.wav,X,4.0,4.0,3.8,1473,Female,Train," Concisely, you know, and to just really, I guess, not really teach the kids how to go there emotionally."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0153.wav,X,3.2,3.0,4.2,1473,Female,Train," Make us think. And like you said, if you ask the right one, I think the kids, even us, adults, will find the right words to say if the right question is asked."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0164.wav,X,4.0,4.4,4.6,1473,Female,Train, What advice would you give to?
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0170.wav,X,3.6,3.4,3.2,1473,Female,Train," So well in so few words. And I think teachers will want to know if there were any strategies, if anything came to mind. Again, we mentioned."

MSP-PODCAST_2447_0189.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.0,1472,Female,Train, Getting comfortable with ourselves and setting up the environment and the spaces for ourselves to feel safe enough to just tell the story.
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0194.wav,X,5.0,4.8,4.8,1473,Female,Train," It is okay to spill your emotions, you know, out on the page in my classroom and then there will be no judgment."
MSP-PODCAST_2447_0195.wav,X,4.8,5.4,4.4,1473,Female,Train, So I think you're right and thank you for reminding us of that.

MSP-PODCAST_2448_0063.wav,X,4.4,5.0,4.8,1474,Female,Train, I'm very sure that I didn't have the capacity to do the illustrations in the way that I wanted them to be for the final product.
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0066.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.2,1474,Female,Train, I know that it's very unusual to have the chance to work really closely with the artist or the illustrator for your book.
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0073.wav,X,4.2,5.0,4.6,1476,Female,Train," I also knew you from working at NWP and I knew you would carry through with your plans and I remember asking you, how do you?"

MSP-PODCAST_2448_0114.wav,X,3.6,4.8,3.8,1475,Female,Train, It surprised me in looking at the illustrations in that I could see all the work that you two had done.
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0131.wav,X,3.8,5.4,5.2,1474,Female,Train, And go to the end of the book so that children are exposed to them twice.
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0136.wav,X,3.4,4.0,3.2,1474,Female,Train," First, second, third graders love to spend time with books and they like to go, meaning that they like to go back to the same one over and over."
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0142.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.0,1459,Female,Train, It seems like such an interesting part of a composition process.
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0159.wav,X,4.8,5.2,4.6,1474,Female,Train," the same place to have that if the text is going to be at the bottom as they're just beginning to learn to read, they know to look for it there."

MSP-PODCAST_2448_0211.wav,X,3.8,4.4,4.2,1459,Female,Train," Maybe we could just go back for a second and sort of talk through, you've just talked through so many different pieces."
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0216.wav,X,4.8,4.6,4.2,1474,Female,Train," And I asked her if she would be interested. And yes, she was interested. And then I don't know what happened for a couple of years. And then I gave the draft to Amy."
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0217.wav,X,5.4,5.8,5.8,1474,Female,Train," And asked her for her feedback, which she gave me. And again, thank goodness, I don't throw anything out because I still, you know, when I came back to it again."
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0221.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.2,1474,Female,Train," I actually hadn't thought about giving it to her. I don't that seems silly when I say it out loud now, but thankfully a friend was able to make a copy of it, give it."
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0241.wav,X,5.0,5.2,4.6,1459,Female,Train," Like what happens when you just, you know, hold onto your ideas and one day you're able to do it and it's able to come together. So I know you just."

MSP-PODCAST_2448_0338.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.4,1476,Female,Train," What it came down to is how it would affect the story visually. And I think that as a visual artist, you need to be able to articulate that for the writer."
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0350.wav,X,4.6,5.0,4.6,1459,Female,Train," And from your perspective as an editor, how valuable it is to hear the conversations among, you know, this sort of unpacking, debriefing. I don't know if you're a"
MSP-PODCAST_2448_0351.wav,X,4.4,4.0,4.2,1459,Female,Train," But sort of like talking through what actually happened, how you all learned from each other and how valuable that is. And I feel like from a with a teacher and a writing."

MSP-PODCAST_2450_0077.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.4,1479,Female,Train, That's been tricky because they then have to figure out how to talk to this new audience in a way that's authentic and that still challenges them to make change.

MSP-PODCAST_2450_0131.wav,X,4.4,4.6,4.4,1479,Female,Train, So it's actually really interesting because I'm actually had to pause on sort of the edit process of that to do Anti Racist Ally. So now I'm back on that and I've been doing.

MSP-PODCAST_2750_0179.wav,X,4.6,3.2,5.0,1511,Female,Train," Black men stop apologizing, stop feeling convicted when you see a dark skinned girl come in the room because at the end of the day we're beautiful."
MSP-PODCAST_2750_0183.wav,X,5.8,2.6,6.0,1511,Female,Train," Cemetery, middle high school. If you were in grade school, you know what?"
MSP-PODCAST_2750_0191.wav,X,4.6,3.4,5.0,1511,Female,Train, You look like melted chocolate. You know when chocolate.
MSP-PODCAST_2751_0050.wav,X,3.4,2.8,4.2,1511,Female,Train, That is hindering you from tapping into your potential.

MSP-PODCAST_2751_0125.wav,X,4.4,2.8,4.6,1511,Female,Train, They wouldn't even be as far as they are now.
MSP-PODCAST_2751_0152.wav,X,3.4,5.2,4.4,1511,Female,Train, So definitely can't wait to play with this some more and see what they got going on cause they.

MSP-PODCAST_2752_0062.wav,X,3.2,2.8,5.4,1511,Female,Train, I am never racking up a credit card like that ever again.
MSP-PODCAST_2752_0098.wav,X,3.6,4.6,3.8,1511,Female,Train," It's really something, but I would not have it any other way."

MSP-PODCAST_2753_0086.wav,X,5.4,4.6,5.2,1511,Female,Train, I feel like memberships and trainers are great investments. I feel like if they are taking.
MSP-PODCAST_2753_0105.wav,X,5.2,2.8,5.6,1511,Female,Train, If I know more than they do.
MSP-PODCAST_2753_0109.wav,X,4.2,3.8,3.8,1511,Female,Train," They can't do it at certain times, which is very understandable."
MSP-PODCAST_2753_0142.wav,X,4.0,3.8,4.0,1511,Female,Train," So Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I normally don't work out. Monday through Thursday, that's when I work out."

MSP-PODCAST_2760_0030.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.8,1595,Female,Train, And not just see black women refer to reference to white women and it's deficit based.
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0049.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.6,1595,Female,Train, American community survey or you're using the decennial census or you're using the current population survey. All of that data collects.
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0074.wav,X,3.8,3.0,4.2,1595,Female,Train," And I feel like in that instance, it's a comparison that shouldn't be deficit based or it puts any particular race or ethnicity in quotation marks above."
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0077.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.6,1595,Female,Train, How do you disaggregate this data and write reports so that you're not referencing a particular?
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0124.wav,X,2.2,2.8,3.4,1595,Female,Train, And it's not the way the term was intended to be used.
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0142.wav,X,2.8,3.4,3.4,1595,Female,Train," But there's, but the other part of that is when you're talking about black women economists, we're very, very small."
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0164.wav,X,2.8,2.8,4.0,1595,Female,Train, That's frightening to me from a national security.
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0179.wav,X,2.6,3.4,3.4,1595,Female,Train, Honest conversation that will lead to a definition of diversity because we're doing really well in terms of geographic diversity.
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0204.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.2,1595,Female,Train," And if you compared that to the growth for black men,"
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0233.wav,X,2.2,3.4,2.8,1595,Female,Train," I think in a way that they may not have been with Obama because they felt like we had a black president, you know, as a term."
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0255.wav,X,2.6,3.0,3.0,1595,Female,Train," If you're not talking about single and black, I don't even hear them talking about single people."
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0272.wav,X,2.8,3.2,3.6,1595,Female,Train, Right. And I don't think that our policies take that into consideration. Right. They.
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0293.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.0,1595,Female,Train," Right. So even in that conversation when we talk about pay equity,"
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0315.wav,X,5.2,5.0,5.0,1595,Female,Train," And you probably don't want to be on the list of what millennials aren't having, but I think."

MSP-PODCAST_2760_0331.wav,X,5.6,4.2,4.6,1595,Female,Train," But but you know, and that's an interesting cause I think for me, I."
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0338.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.6,1595,Female,Train, I think that we should be asking ICE to do their job.
MSP-PODCAST_2760_0342.wav,X,4.0,3.6,3.4,1595,Female,Train, Who look mestizo? Go get everyone. You know where the white communities are.
MSP-PODCAST_2761_0098.wav,X,3.8,3.2,4.0,1598,Male,Train," increases in red states. Now, in part, it's not."
MSP-PODCAST_2761_0317.wav,X,3.0,3.8,3.8,1598,Male,Train, Immigration policies are important to sustaining the economy.
MSP-PODCAST_2789_0041.wav,X,3.6,4.0,4.6,227,Male,Train, People are less well paid or there are fewer benefits.
MSP-PODCAST_2789_0046.wav,X,3.6,4.0,4.6,227,Male,Train," So it has nothing to do with the amount of money they make, with how good or bad they are, with one."
MSP-PODCAST_2789_0070.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.8,227,Male,Train," You could get a nail, drive it two inches deep into solid."
MSP-PODCAST_2789_0083.wav,X,3.6,3.4,4.0,227,Male,Train," memory about how evil hammers are and that they're a sign of the devil. And all of a sudden, nobody."
MSP-PODCAST_2789_0220.wav,X,3.8,3.8,4.2,227,Male,Train," education, knowledge, all of the things that we want that many nonprofits go for."
MSP-PODCAST_2789_0223.wav,X,3.8,3.8,4.8,227,Male,Train," In terms of enhancing education, all of those things. Doesn't mean nonprofits are immoral or bad."
MSP-PODCAST_2789_0234.wav,X,2.8,3.6,4.2,227,Male,Train, Because there is no legal monopoly.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0071.wav,X,4.0,3.6,4.2,228,Male,Train, I think about a process that can never be meaningfully divorced from doing it for you.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0072.wav,X,4.2,2.6,4.6,228,Male,Train, If you're not doing it for yourself or for something that appeals to you.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0076.wav,X,5.2,3.6,4.2,228,Male,Train, But let's unpack that a little bit in order to make it clear.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0087.wav,X,4.8,3.4,4.6,228,Male,Train, How do most people learn how to read and what's?
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0099.wav,X,4.8,2.6,5.0,228,Male,Train," assigning them what to read, but they're asking them."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0101.wav,X,4.6,3.0,4.8,228,Male,Train," That says, when I read, I'm reading because it is important to someone who has power in my society and I'm reading for the purpose."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0107.wav,X,4.6,2.4,5.0,228,Male,Train, And I think that's very tragic because it's not.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0188.wav,X,5.0,2.6,4.4,227,Male,Train," interpretation before through which it could have done something for you. And if not, I mean, if so."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0191.wav,X,4.2,3.2,4.6,227,Male,Train, Uses to gain value from something.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0202.wav,X,4.8,3.4,4.4,228,Male,Train," place for that kind of thinking. However, we should."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0207.wav,X,3.8,3.0,4.4,228,Male,Train, to that. And so when people don't have that idea.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0208.wav,X,5.2,3.0,5.0,228,Male,Train," Exercise, then the only way they know how to meaningfully engage a text is by reading."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0212.wav,X,5.0,3.0,4.8,228,Male,Train, Just I know a lot of people say never waste your time reading comments and I get the arguments for that and there's a lot of that that I do agree with.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0220.wav,X,4.4,4.6,5.2,227,Male,Train," Okay, so why are we supposed to go read comments? It sounds horrible to me. You gotta get."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0243.wav,X,4.4,2.4,4.6,228,Male,Train," If there's some imperfection in the person, it's just sort of like, okay, all right."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0253.wav,X,4.6,2.4,4.8,228,Male,Train," Selfish to spend any time, you know, debating the people who want to go over this nuance point or anything like that."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0254.wav,X,4.4,3.0,5.0,228,Male,Train," Even though again, there can be a time and a place for that."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0272.wav,X,3.0,3.2,4.2,227,Male,Train, Why am I spending my valuable time telling you that? Just move.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0293.wav,X,4.2,2.8,4.4,228,Male,Train," Rules might be neutral in many cases, most of them don't come in."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0294.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.6,228,Male,Train, into existence because of some process of trying to consciously figure out how to make children more intelligent or creative.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0295.wav,X,4.8,2.4,4.8,228,Male,Train, Most of these rules or many of them come into existence for no other reason than that.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0314.wav,X,3.4,3.4,4.6,228,Male,Train," Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with these things."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0319.wav,X,3.8,3.6,4.4,228,Male,Train, responsible for managing these kids. You're going to have some kids.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0330.wav,X,4.4,3.6,4.8,228,Male,Train, That these rules exist because people are a part of institutions where they are incentivized to create regulations that make it.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0333.wav,X,5.0,3.6,4.2,228,Male,Train, Walking in straight lines generates creative thinking. That's not how they come up.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0343.wav,X,5.2,3.2,5.0,228,Male,Train, Actually learning when you read. I have to answer to parents. I have to answer to a.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0345.wav,X,4.8,2.6,5.0,228,Male,Train," I have to also have a way of testing you, having a way of quantifying this experience."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0350.wav,X,4.4,2.8,5.0,228,Male,Train, Is that they're seeking or that helps them avoid trouble because nobody wants to get an answer.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0352.wav,X,4.2,2.4,4.8,228,Male,Train, Nobody wants to get in trouble with their parents. Nobody wants to be held.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0419.wav,X,4.4,4.4,5.0,228,Male,Train," There's also a positive side, right, where we like the way it feels to get praise."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0450.wav,X,5.2,3.6,5.4,228,Male,Train," So, so for me, this, this one particular thing has never been a fight."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0454.wav,X,4.8,2.6,5.4,228,Male,Train," It's useless and you know, pursue the truth and it doesn't matter who the truth comes from."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0461.wav,X,4.8,3.2,5.0,228,Male,Train, My eyes fall backwards and expect him to catch me.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0467.wav,X,4.4,2.4,4.4,228,Male,Train, Basically made it clear to me from the beginning that if you're looking for truth to come from a source of perfection.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0468.wav,X,4.0,2.6,4.6,228,Male,Train, Then you're really never going to be able to learn because you have to rely on human beings and you have to interact with them.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0480.wav,X,4.6,4.6,5.0,228,Male,Train," Ask me, he said, your parents let you read that stuff. And I said, yeah, they let me read what I want. And he said, oh, my parents don't let me read."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0483.wav,X,5.0,3.2,4.4,228,Male,Train," I just felt sorry for him. Like, man, that's messed up. Like, because you're missing out on some really good stories because of your parents' elitist ideas about what you ought to do."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0487.wav,X,5.0,4.8,5.4,228,Male,Train," Well, I've always liked reading because I didn't learn how to read from school. I learned how to read from my pa."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0489.wav,X,4.4,3.2,5.0,228,Male,Train," early on to associate reading, not as something that's out."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0500.wav,X,4.2,2.4,5.2,228,Male,Train," It became kind of a struggle because I felt like it got in the way of my learning, because I had less time to read what I wanted to read."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0501.wav,X,4.2,3.0,4.6,228,Male,Train, Because I had to spend so much time reading what someone else wanted me to read.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0505.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.4,228,Male,Train," In order to be able to answer questions in past tests, I see."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0511.wav,X,4.8,3.2,5.2,228,Male,Train," I might hate most of the book, but find chapter five to be amazing, and I might read chapter five."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0548.wav,X,4.8,2.8,4.8,228,Male,Train," I would say, understand that criticism and disagreement are very valuable, but to take them."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0549.wav,X,5.6,2.4,5.4,228,Male,Train, Take time expressing criticism and disagreement is a potentially costful activity.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0557.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.8,228,Male,Train, be misconstrued or misused. And that can very quickly lead to a life where you're just commenting on everything.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0586.wav,X,5.0,3.0,4.8,228,Male,Train," Now, here's what it's like to read that with a selfish perspective. You look at the."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0588.wav,X,4.6,3.0,5.0,228,Male,Train, I get it. Zig is talking about the power of value creation.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0592.wav,X,4.2,4.6,5.2,228,Male,Train, Using what I already have to create value for them. All right.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0596.wav,X,5.4,3.6,4.8,228,Male,Train, He just said I can get everything I want if I help enough people get what they want.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0603.wav,X,5.6,2.6,5.0,228,Male,Train," I think before you spend your time doing that, because there is a trade off, you got to take away from your learning time and your creativity."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0604.wav,X,5.0,3.0,4.0,228,Male,Train, Activity time to do that. So before you do something like that.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0608.wav,X,4.4,3.0,5.0,228,Male,Train," You know, this advice doesn't apply to every possible."
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0611.wav,X,3.6,3.6,4.6,228,Male,Train, That's a personal call. I know there are some people who are listening to this and they will always feel like it is the best use of their time to protect the world from possibility.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0643.wav,X,4.0,3.6,3.8,228,Male,Train, Unbelievably stupidity for me to even entertain the idea for a single second.
MSP-PODCAST_2791_0644.wav,X,4.0,3.8,4.0,228,Male,Train," That you, I or anybody else on God's grain earth would have anything to add to that man's words."
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0095.wav,X,3.8,5.0,4.2,229,Male,Train, That's a really good question.
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0138.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.4,229,Male,Train," After I got through all that stuff, people said, Hey, you know, you should talk about this. And I said, You know what?"
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0173.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.2,229,Male,Train," work that I did. It's very competitive. There's a lot of companies, even just here in New Hampshire, that are doing that and trying to make deals with public schools for, you know,"
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0237.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.4,229,Male,Train," only going to add to the pressure because with what's happened in higher education, quote, unquote, in the last couple of days."
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0244.wav,X,3.0,2.8,3.6,229,Male,Train," One of my parents did, I don't even know if my mom actually graduated from college."
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0255.wav,X,4.0,3.0,4.6,229,Male,Train," I would say if you want college to be worth something and this kind of goes to adding on to the pressure, you really have to go to work."
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0349.wav,X,4.0,2.8,4.6,227,Male,Train," Accustomed to just always obeying authority and getting rewarded for following the rules, they're going to be much more."
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0356.wav,X,3.8,3.2,4.2,229,Male,Train," twelve years in that authoritarian environment, they will go out and be"
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0432.wav,X,2.8,2.8,4.4,227,Male,Train," But the problem is you can't really do one about them without people being like, you're a conspiracy theorist. And he's like, that."
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0436.wav,X,5.0,4.0,5.0,227,Male,Train," They're crazy and most of them are, you know, probably false."
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0609.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.2,227,Male,Train, It's a little bit troublesome. So to sort of to connect this to the education topic.
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0629.wav,X,3.4,3.8,3.8,229,Male,Train, A sense of nationalism.
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0700.wav,X,3.8,4.4,4.4,227,Male,Train," Shape people into good, obedient citizens. I remember reading even even our wonderful independence love."
MSP-PODCAST_2792_0704.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.4,227,Male,Train, So let's create a free school that's too good of a deal for any of the parents to turn down because it's going to.

MSP-PODCAST_2792_1031.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.6,229,Male,Train," Well, let's see. I the episodes that I've had the most fun with would be."
MSP-PODCAST_2793_0009.wav,X,5.0,3.8,4.8,227,Male,Train, Good thing. That's not a bad thing. Not everyone wants to.
MSP-PODCAST_2793_0024.wav,X,4.0,3.2,4.0,227,Male,Train," Then if I do, by mid December I'm sick of it. And then I'm like, well, cool."
MSP-PODCAST_2793_0076.wav,X,4.2,3.0,3.4,227,Male,Train, It is the worst sappiest like.

MSP-PODCAST_2912_0187.wav,X,3.4,2.8,4.4,293,Male,Train, So these payment processors unfairly target.

MSP-PODCAST_2913_0353.wav,X,5.4,5.4,5.0,804,Male,Train," So I think it's interesting that, you know, as I travel around the world."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0356.wav,X,5.2,5.2,5.0,804,Male,Train, Really excited about San Francisco and not that I don't love San Francisco as well.

MSP-PODCAST_2913_0399.wav,X,4.666667,3.0,4.0,804,Male,Train, And I think that's going to become a bigger issue because I think it's Estonia is not alone in setting this up.

MSP-PODCAST_2913_0458.wav,X,4.2,3.4,4.4,803,Female,Train, And I think it's a bit worrying when these ICO.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0463.wav,X,4.4,2.6,4.8,804,Male,Train, They're really not ready to set up the crowdfunding projects.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0467.wav,X,4.8,4.4,3.8,804,Male,Train," It's actually really an interesting point that when the arbitration, arbitral clauses have to be set up at the time which you set up the venture at the time which you."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0469.wav,X,5.0,3.8,4.0,804,Male,Train," But you know, arbitration's great for blockchain disputes."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0472.wav,X,4.8,5.2,4.4,803,Female,Train, And you're completely right as you're setting it up.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0477.wav,X,4.4,4.4,3.8,804,Male,Train," And arbitration, I think, actually is the right way of doing it."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0491.wav,X,3.8,4.6,4.4,803,Female,Train," Also, they have an international rules body and you can select international as well."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0499.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.4,803,Female,Train," And I would imagine, just thinking about the way civil litigation works."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0502.wav,X,5.6,4.8,5.0,803,Female,Train, And then what you could say is we're going to automate what happens if this dispute arises.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0559.wav,X,5.2,3.2,5.0,804,Male,Train," to a bad actor using that same door and modifying and taking advantage of that door, right?"
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0590.wav,X,5.0,3.8,4.8,803,Female,Train, Right. So eventually the cryptography that's in Bitcoin right now that.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0593.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.4,803,Female,Train, So it's not about having code that we know is going to run.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0610.wav,X,5.0,3.8,4.2,803,Female,Train," So the insolvency, I think the insolvency zone is the one we're talking about. It's pre insolvency when you know you can't pay your debts as and when they fall."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0617.wav,X,4.2,3.0,4.6,803,Female,Train, breached the rules that say you can't trade while you're insolvent.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0630.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.2,804,Male,Train, I think everybody's pretty much accepting that they do exist.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0636.wav,X,5.0,3.4,4.8,804,Male,Train, I just wanted to put it out there for discussion. And I think it's a hidden problem for all developers and also their advisors.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0682.wav,X,5.2,4.2,5.2,804,Male,Train," The old rule is, well, the rule is don't invest in anything you can't afford to lose. And so, you know, it's I don't see anyone doing that."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0723.wav,X,3.4,2.8,3.6,804,Male,Train," And yet he's on the verge of he hasn't been deported, but he."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0730.wav,X,4.6,3.8,3.8,804,Male,Train," I think that one of the problems with the regulator bringing the prosecution is, of course, you've got the higher standard, you've got the higher burden of proof. So they've got to prove."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0732.wav,X,4.4,2.8,4.6,803,Female,Train, And then the other problem is you need the information provided by the victims.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0750.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.2,357,Female,Train," And then you can do it. And especially that thing about having the arbitration and having, you know,"
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0751.wav,X,4.4,3.2,5.0,357,Female,Train, There's also that thing of the answer to the machine is in the machine.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0755.wav,X,4.8,5.0,4.8,357,Female,Train," And ninety percent of people want to do the right thing, want to do it."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0763.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.0,357,Female,Train," I mean, obviously I'm nowhere near up to speed on this as a technologist."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0765.wav,X,4.4,3.6,4.6,357,Female,Train, That should work. It's really important to do that so that there can be some confidence built into the way that we're all going to move forward.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0767.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.8,357,Female,Train," Alex, that momentum that's so important."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0775.wav,X,4.4,4.0,3.4,357,Female,Train, And we focus on the public policy issues that are generated through the availability of these new technologies.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0777.wav,X,3.4,4.2,4.0,357,Female,Train, They allow people to do things that they weren't able to do before.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0806.wav,X,4.2,3.2,3.4,357,Female,Train, But that's not good enough to determine when something is or is not eligible to be regulated in such a heavy duty fashion as securities regulation is.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0822.wav,X,5.2,4.8,4.6,357,Female,Train, It's funny you should say that the orange grove is for sale.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0854.wav,X,4.0,2.2,5.0,357,Female,Train, Josh Garza. Josh Garza also has a history of being a scammer before Paycoin.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0934.wav,X,3.6,4.4,4.4,357,Female,Train," If that country has extradition, which most friendly countries do."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0936.wav,X,3.4,4.0,4.4,357,Female,Train, So we have this looming threat.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0939.wav,X,3.4,4.8,4.8,357,Female,Train, in the summer of twenty fifteen was present a framework to the SEC that we felt would be helpful for them in first understanding how these technologies work.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0951.wav,X,4.0,4.2,4.2,357,Female,Train," It's a common enterprise, but not the kind of common enterprise that we regulate as an issuer of securities."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0964.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.0,357,Female,Train," Say, this amount of decentralization in mining and in software development makes it look like we don't have a common enterprise."
MSP-PODCAST_2913_0969.wav,X,4.8,3.4,4.6,357,Female,Train, Maybe even just Josh Garza. Contrast Paycoin when it comes to was there distributed mining.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_1043.wav,X,4.6,5.2,4.4,308,Male,Train, Because Ethereum is a platform for decentralized computing that makes it very easy to issue these tokens.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_1049.wav,X,3.2,3.6,3.6,308,Male,Train, The only way to ever authoritatively say that something is or is not a security is to be a federal judge.
MSP-PODCAST_2913_1106.wav,X,4.8,4.2,5.0,308,Male,Train," Then those giant investors could vote to send everybody's money to themselves, with no chance of."
MSP-PODCAST_2914_0014.wav,X,4.2,4.8,3.8,308,Male,Train, And their event is a good place to gain an insight into the culture of the group.
MSP-PODCAST_2914_0019.wav,X,3.2,4.6,4.2,308,Male,Train, It's just a really worthwhile event to attend.
MSP-PODCAST_2914_0151.wav,X,4.6,4.8,5.2,308,Male,Train," But still publicly coming forward and minimizing it. Also, it was interesting if you look through the comments."
MSP-PODCAST_2915_0031.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.4,351,Male,Train, This is huge. It basically enables machines to produce and sell data and interact autonomously without human intervention.
MSP-PODCAST_2915_0042.wav,X,3.0,3.8,3.6,351,Male,Train," Identity, permission control and things like this."
MSP-PODCAST_2915_0045.wav,X,4.2,3.0,3.8,351,Male,Train, Plus binds some kind of producing identity to all the data points.
MSP-PODCAST_2915_0082.wav,X,3.6,3.2,3.6,278,Female,Train, This case of therium and the value of that data is somehow tokenized to k.
MSP-PODCAST_2915_0103.wav,X,3.2,4.6,3.8,278,Female,Train, So I can basically define the terms quite freely and how the payment system works.
MSP-PODCAST_2915_0144.wav,X,2.6,3.6,3.0,278,Female,Train," Stream. And this is, of course, how we also achieve data privacy in a network."
MSP-PODCAST_2915_0177.wav,X,3.8,3.2,4.2,789,Female,Train, There will be too much data that any non obvious patterns too difficult.
MSP-PODCAST_2915_0189.wav,X,3.2,4.2,4.4,790,Male,Train, What sets us apart from many other projects in this space is that we actually have something that's up and running at the moment.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0013.wav,X,4.2,4.8,3.8,790,Male,Train," MME, who was famous for running the Ethereum crowd sale."
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0018.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.0,789,Female,Train," Oh yes, we're happy to do that. The launch of Ethereum as the first tokens."
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0021.wav,X,3.4,3.6,4.4,790,Male,Train, Our first advice area was to find out whether or not they fall under.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0043.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.2,789,Female,Train, It does not fall the Swiss law under the anti money laundering legislation.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0050.wav,X,4.4,3.8,4.2,326,Female,Train, participation in a token generating event under the anti money laundering legislation.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0070.wav,X,4.0,3.6,4.2,326,Female,Train, And that makes it difficult to decide whether or not your token you generate is now falling under securities law or not. In Switzerland.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0092.wav,X,3.6,3.6,4.8,326,Female,Train, And this is a mandatory audit for.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0098.wav,X,3.8,4.0,4.4,325,Male,Train," So you see, the concept is different. In the US."
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0117.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.6,326,Female,Train, One structure. It's not for every token generating event.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0123.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.4,326,Female,Train, Let's say multi jurisdictional reach and impact.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0125.wav,X,4.6,5.0,4.4,325,Male,Train, One is how you structure a token generating event.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0153.wav,X,3.8,4.0,3.8,325,Male,Train, which you go through to qualify the token generating events.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0166.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.2,326,Female,Train, You have to also qualify the token issuance based on a tax level.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0176.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.2,326,Female,Train," Interesting new things around this token generating events, which is not only limited to jurisdictional questions."
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0186.wav,X,3.8,5.0,4.6,325,Male,Train," We have a new type of community based funding, which I think will have a huge impact in the future and will be a solid model as well in the future."

MSP-PODCAST_2916_0190.wav,X,3.6,3.8,4.0,326,Female,Train, which are a lot around in the market because for the overall community.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0223.wav,X,2.8,4.4,4.0,325,Male,Train," You see, first is the genuine decentralized nature of our government."
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0228.wav,X,4.4,4.0,4.4,325,Male,Train," It's new, it's pilot, you would need as stable as possible legal jurisdiction, which Switzerland can offer."
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0257.wav,X,5.0,4.6,4.2,326,Female,Train, Ethereum emerged with Ethereum. Ethereum was the first attractive player in the crypto valley.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0261.wav,X,3.6,4.2,4.4,325,Male,Train, So we see the disadvantage of this high cost to develop a business in Switzerland.
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0274.wav,X,4.0,4.2,3.6,326,Female,Train," They further support this activity with educational events, with social events."
MSP-PODCAST_2916_0287.wav,X,3.8,3.6,3.6,326,Female,Train, We will have it because we will proceed now in developing our concepts in auditing and do quality checks for token generating event projects.

MSP-PODCAST_2917_0072.wav,X,5.4,3.4,4.4,795,Female,Train, You shouldn't need to build out an entire platform and consider all of this compliance issues and the regulation incredibly deeply.
MSP-PODCAST_2917_0228.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.2,348,Male,Train, significant role in creating an environment where some of that signal can shine.
MSP-PODCAST_2917_0231.wav,X,5.2,4.2,4.4,348,Male,Train," Of course, ultimately, you know, with any investment platform like Angelus and so on."

MSP-PODCAST_2917_0278.wav,X,4.6,3.8,4.6,829,Male,Train," There needs to be experimentation in the future. And we really hope that through basic auditing, you can suss out things such as, you know, right now, some of these."
MSP-PODCAST_2917_0284.wav,X,3.8,4.4,3.6,829,Male,Train," from a place which is much, much easier to understand."

MSP-PODCAST_2917_0326.wav,X,5.2,3.4,4.8,281,Female,Train, Investment purely because part of the problem is this onerous culture of regulation in the US that is preventing projects from raising money in the states. But at the same time.
MSP-PODCAST_2917_0355.wav,X,3.6,2.8,4.0,290,Male,Train, The law there doesn't quite match some set of cases.
MSP-PODCAST_2917_0406.wav,X,3.2,4.4,4.4,376,Male,Train, Incentivizing them to come into the space and then also developing young technical talent to grow and contribute to this space.
MSP-PODCAST_2917_0408.wav,X,3.8,4.4,3.8,376,Male,Train, A lot of the developers that contributed to the early days of Ethereum have done extremely well for themselves.
MSP-PODCAST_2917_0409.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.2,376,Male,Train, So there's some early examples and hopefully that will.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0010.wav,X,3.8,4.6,3.6,376,Male,Train," Participants were Pip Ryan, Pamela Morgan."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0065.wav,X,4.2,5.0,4.6,348,Male,Train," Let's say IPO the public. And in order to do that, it needs to be done."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0091.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.4,348,Male,Train, I really love the fact that you went through everything so clearly in relation to these questions that are going to give us problems.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0108.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.2,348,Male,Train, We have accompanied that mine's gold.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0109.wav,X,4.6,5.2,4.8,348,Male,Train, And that all goes into the disclosure and you're one hundred percent.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0122.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.0,348,Male,Train, Can I just jump in there about terminology? And this is a thing of dealing with different jurisdictions in New Zealand.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0136.wav,X,4.0,4.6,4.0,348,Male,Train, And so it's the language matters.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0141.wav,X,4.6,3.2,4.6,348,Male,Train, what it is fundamentally because you can say.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0173.wav,X,4.8,4.0,4.2,374,Female,Train, They want the affiliation with an IPO.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_0996.wav,X,3.6,3.6,4.0,933,Male,Train," A tenant, for example, sued the co op board for securities fraud."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1018.wav,X,4.4,3.4,3.8,417,Male,Train," So these people, these organizations, they."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1020.wav,X,3.8,3.8,4.2,417,Male,Train," Sometimes. Apparently Augusta, you can't even buy a membership."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1034.wav,X,3.0,3.0,2.8,417,Male,Train," You know, you know, you know, feel rich. It's gonna be awesome."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1036.wav,X,4.8,4.8,4.2,417,Male,Train," price now, we'll use the money to build it, and then you'll be golden."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1042.wav,X,4.0,5.0,4.4,417,Male,Train, like a security. And those are the big parts of our framework that are relevant to say the Ethereum community.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1043.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.4,935,Male,Train, Because Ethereum is a platform for decentralized computing that makes it very easy to issue these tokens.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1067.wav,X,3.2,4.2,3.8,933,Male,Train," For example, are not securities."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1087.wav,X,4.0,5.0,3.4,935,Male,Train," They get Dao tokens, which afford them voting rights."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1108.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.6,935,Male,Train, would be screwed. So the split contract was an escape valve for that forty nine percent.
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1117.wav,X,4.4,4.0,4.2,417,Male,Train," But found a reentrancy bug in the code that allowed the split function to basically be called repeatedly. And every time that split function is called, that person."
MSP-PODCAST_2918_1120.wav,X,4.6,3.4,4.2,417,Male,Train, Ether from the common Dow fund than you ever put in. A disaster.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0013.wav,X,4.0,2.8,4.6,934,Male,Train," However, I thought the space was immature for that."
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0018.wav,X,4.8,5.0,4.4,934,Male,Train, I was very excited about Meta Mask around that time.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0021.wav,X,3.6,4.2,4.0,499,Female,Train, And I was actually doing internal education sessions about smart contracts.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0032.wav,X,3.2,4.0,3.6,499,Female,Train, So I have been following the Ethereum ecosystem literally since day one.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0035.wav,X,4.6,3.8,4.2,499,Female,Train, looking for projects to deploy capital into in the Ethereum ecosystem.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0044.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.2,499,Female,Train, but also develop a community around their blockchain enabled projects.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0068.wav,X,4.2,3.8,5.0,499,Female,Train, Which is exactly who you want to hire.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0105.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.6,501,Female,Train, And I've sort of just annexed his talent to do it on behalf of the Polychain Fund with a little bit of a larger amount of money.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0120.wav,X,3.4,3.2,3.4,501,Female,Train, This compelling vision about where this space is going.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0121.wav,X,3.8,3.6,3.2,501,Female,Train," And convince these, you know, these."
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0123.wav,X,3.6,4.4,4.0,501,Female,Train," blockchain enabled projects so that they, these firms have exposure to this important movement without needing to get into"
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0137.wav,X,5.0,4.2,4.4,501,Female,Train, So when I look at all of these components.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0142.wav,X,4.6,4.2,5.0,501,Female,Train," I think for us to have a really robust, decentralized stack that's easy for an application developer to."
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0145.wav,X,4.8,4.6,4.4,501,Female,Train," being really robust. Once that stack is robust and easy to use for a normal kind of application developer, then"
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0152.wav,X,5.2,4.8,4.4,501,Female,Train," Anything, any of these major web services of the last fifteen years were really built with this structure."
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0162.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.4,501,Female,Train," They are the users, and the users of a peer to peer protocol actually own that protocol."
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0168.wav,X,4.0,3.2,4.4,501,Female,Train," You know, I sometimes feel like when I'm comparing these decentralized protocols to centralized companies."
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0174.wav,X,3.6,4.4,4.4,501,Female,Train, And I actually think we're at a similar place now where what I can come up with is Twitter.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0211.wav,X,4.8,4.0,5.2,478,Female,Train, They actually provide a valuable service within the decentralized network or blockchain enabled project that
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0228.wav,X,4.8,4.0,5.8,478,Female,Train, That's what I love is that there's so many different experiments happening. And I think it will take a while and a lot of projects needing to fail and others.
MSP-PODCAST_2919_0232.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.0,478,Female,Train, And then to Olaf's point there.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0011.wav,X,4.2,5.0,4.8,1375,Male,Train," Well, Norton, let's start with icy rocks."
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0055.wav,X,4.4,4.8,5.0,1375,Male,Train, Currently two major ones supported right now that compile to webassembly.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0070.wav,X,3.6,3.0,4.4,1374,Male,Train," And now, how do you know that they're not going to steal your money?"
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0072.wav,X,4.2,3.2,4.2,1374,Male,Train, Just check that the functions don't have a function that say you steal my money.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0096.wav,X,5.0,4.0,4.2,1375,Male,Train, They don't really have great tooling to manage their neurons.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0119.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.6,1375,Male,Train, You could have Axon control those funds as well.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0126.wav,X,5.0,4.4,4.4,1375,Male,Train, able to access and control their neurons.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0137.wav,X,4.4,4.2,5.0,1375,Male,Train," I have all my neurons locked in cold storage and like, you know, how do I manage my neurons?"
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0158.wav,X,3.6,4.6,3.2,1375,Male,Train, And I definitely think that we'll see more community led efforts on these wallets and neuron management applications.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0159.wav,X,4.6,5.0,4.6,1375,Male,Train, What I find really cool about the situation that you just described is you can spin a narrative about a closed off foundation that's not listening to the community.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0161.wav,X,4.4,4.8,5.2,1375,Male,Train, Which is an organization that has produced this platform that has a certain mindset about how it can be used.
MSP-PODCAST_2920_0247.wav,X,4.0,3.2,4.4,1374,Male,Train, I don't know how actively like cycle dow is going to be.

MSP-PODCAST_2921_0153.wav,X,5.6,4.8,4.4,1374,Male,Train, So much more has happened since the idea of social bubbles was first introduced.

MSP-PODCAST_2921_0172.wav,X,3.0,3.2,4.0,1374,Male,Train, No age is protected against the virus.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0173.wav,X,4.4,3.0,4.2,1374,Male,Train," We are also seeing outbreaks in school settings, and we are also seeing outbreaks in workplaces or in other establishments where."

MSP-PODCAST_2921_0186.wav,X,3.6,3.2,4.2,1375,Male,Train, Against alpha variant will not be the same that you get against the delta variant.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0195.wav,X,5.2,5.0,4.6,1375,Male,Train, Some say contracting the disease provides better immunity than vaccines.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0199.wav,X,3.8,3.8,4.4,1375,Male,Train, Especially in the context of COVID nineteen and the COVID nineteen vaccines.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0208.wav,X,3.8,4.4,4.6,1375,Male,Train, One of the other statements here is if you don't have COVID symptoms.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0212.wav,X,4.2,3.0,4.4,1375,Male,Train, Which means that they will not show the symptoms.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0220.wav,X,4.0,4.4,4.0,1375,Male,Train," Okay, let's talk a bit about a treatment that we've heard out there because a very popular podcaster named Joe Rogan has announced that he has COVID eight."
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0225.wav,X,3.6,3.0,4.0,1375,Male,Train, You could say it's a deworming medication that is used in humans and animals.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0226.wav,X,3.0,3.2,4.0,1375,Male,Train," It is not recommended, so please don't use this as a treatment for COVID nineteen."
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0241.wav,X,4.0,3.2,4.4,1375,Male,Train, This is also misinformation because what you're seeing in most cases with vaccines is you get injection pain.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0250.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.2,1374,Male,Train, Get infection after being fully vaccinated.
MSP-PODCAST_2921_0264.wav,X,4.4,3.2,3.4,1375,Male,Train," For example, not just like in three days, you might have shortness of breath."

MSP-PODCAST_2921_0276.wav,X,4.0,3.6,4.8,1374,Male,Train, So vaccinated is very important that you get vaccinated.

MSP-PODCAST_2931_0172.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.2,1374,Male,Train, Why did it matter that you were able to identify any of these people?
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0183.wav,X,3.8,3.2,4.2,1374,Male,Train," Sometimes, certainly unintentional, that the men, you know, the people involved in this tend to be sometimes thought of in the abstract."
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0195.wav,X,4.6,4.0,3.8,1374,Male,Train, But they're not confirmed.
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0210.wav,X,2.4,4.2,3.4,1374,Male,Train," So we in this study were able to by identifying John Gregory, his family at least knows where he died."

MSP-PODCAST_2931_0240.wav,X,2.6,3.6,4.0,1374,Male,Train, And this has been a very successful collaboration.
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0253.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.0,1374,Male,Train, And so on. And that's that's how we got into this. And that was two thousand eight. And so one of the fascinating things for me when I got into the field.
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0261.wav,X,3.6,3.0,4.6,1374,Male,Train, I then got to the sites and it wasn't making any sense at all.
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0265.wav,X,3.8,4.8,4.6,1374,Male,Train, It's been very interesting through some of the work that we have done to challenge some of the long standing interpretations of some of the sites. We don't set out to.
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0276.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.6,1374,Male,Train," For example, or shipwrecks, those sorts of things, two of those problems are now solved."
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0279.wav,X,2.8,4.2,3.4,1374,Male,Train, So now we're getting more information now that allows us to consider more fully the oral.
MSP-PODCAST_2931_0291.wav,X,3.8,3.6,4.2,1374,Male,Train, And we now have quite a bit more data from them.

MSP-PODCAST_2932_0337.wav,X,2.8,3.8,3.2,1381,Male,Train, But I would say that given the lack of knowledge.

MSP-PODCAST_2933_0127.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.8,1381,Male,Train, Experiences and cultures often go in the background of white supremacy. And because of that.
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0129.wav,X,4.4,3.0,4.8,1381,Male,Train," So for me, Asian Heritage Month is not a month to remind ourselves as Asians that we need to learn how to cook."
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0132.wav,X,5.0,5.2,4.6,1381,Male,Train," For example, those things are very important, and we should know and celebrate our culture."
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0145.wav,X,3.8,4.2,3.8,1381,Male,Train, This includes settler colonialism and colonialism in general.
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0148.wav,X,3.6,2.6,4.2,1381,Male,Train, And you see that white supremacy has incredibly harmful effects on all people of color.

MSP-PODCAST_2933_0229.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.4,1381,Male,Train, I think we could be pretty smug.
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0230.wav,X,5.6,3.6,4.8,1381,Male,Train, It does get to be a bit much because we like to cling to reports that we're so kind and polite.
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0235.wav,X,4.8,2.2,4.0,1381,Male,Train, There's an utter refusal to acknowledge that racism even exists in Canada.

MSP-PODCAST_2933_0242.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.8,1381,Male,Train, I think that said that. Were you surprised to read that?
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0249.wav,X,3.6,2.6,4.2,1381,Male,Train, Justified because Asian people are stigmatized as taking more than what they need.
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0255.wav,X,3.6,3.2,4.6,1381,Male,Train, But there's very little acknowledgment of that fact.
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0257.wav,X,4.8,3.4,4.8,1381,Male,Train, That's it. And this suggests a disregard to Asian identity and ways of knowing in the world.
MSP-PODCAST_2933_0259.wav,X,4.2,3.2,4.2,1381,Male,Train," I think, broadly speaking, part of the problem is that in general, folks."

MSP-PODCAST_2934_0201.wav,X,3.6,3.4,4.4,1381,Male,Train, And that's so to feel stressed is normative.
MSP-PODCAST_2934_0204.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.2,1381,Male,Train, Think of an anxiety problem as more of an ongoing.
MSP-PODCAST_2934_0206.wav,X,4.0,3.2,4.0,1381,Male,Train, It may get exacerbated by changes in the environment.

MSP-PODCAST_2934_0217.wav,X,4.6,3.6,4.0,1381,Male,Train, We would say they have arthritis in their left knee. And I think that we want to use that kind of language when we're talking about mental health challenges.

MSP-PODCAST_2934_0265.wav,X,4.6,2.6,4.4,1383,Male,Train, And that in itself undermines our sense of our capacity to cope because we don't have enough information to know what we're going to do.
MSP-PODCAST_2934_0270.wav,X,4.0,3.0,3.6,1383,Male,Train," What happens when we're stressed for months and months at a time, or even a year or more?"

MSP-PODCAST_2934_0326.wav,X,4.4,3.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train, What might be good about any course of action?
MSP-PODCAST_2934_0337.wav,X,2.6,4.2,3.6,1383,Male,Train, If we're able to step back and create distance between ourselves and the perceived threat.
MSP-PODCAST_2934_0347.wav,X,4.0,2.8,3.6,1383,Male,Train, It can affect the body and it can make people quite sick over time.
MSP-PODCAST_2934_0359.wav,X,4.6,3.6,4.4,1383,Male,Train," But what are some perceived stresses that I may not need to be trying to worry about? like so for example, if"

MSP-PODCAST_2934_0361.wav,X,4.4,3.0,4.0,1383,Male,Train, How delayed are they in their education and their development and their learning?
MSP-PODCAST_2934_0384.wav,X,4.6,3.2,4.2,1383,Male,Train, That's fine. But as soon as you're getting beyond that.

MSP-PODCAST_2935_0148.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.4,1383,Male,Train, It's the way that academic advisors would access where the student is at income.
MSP-PODCAST_2935_0162.wav,X,3.4,4.8,4.4,1383,Male,Train," Yeah, I think that's one of the outstanding highlights of Quest Action."
MSP-PODCAST_2935_0184.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.4,1383,Male,Train, I've said that student experience has to be at the forefront of what drives our priorities.
MSP-PODCAST_2935_0207.wav,X,3.8,4.6,4.8,1383,Male,Train, I was actually working for Distance and Continuing Ed.

MSP-PODCAST_2935_0257.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.4,1383,Male,Train, You can now online go in and kind of see how you can shuffle things around and what's available to you that you can fit in to your schedule to.

MSP-PODCAST_2936_0232.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.0,1383,Male,Train, They can be qualitatively accurate over longer time scales.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0239.wav,X,4.8,3.4,5.2,1383,Male,Train, Why did you decide to model the things that you modeled?
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0241.wav,X,4.6,4.6,4.0,1383,Male,Train, Chose our models based on questions that were on many people's minds.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0283.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.4,1383,Male,Train, It got to be difficult because you also didn't know that there was going to be a big contamination at the Johnson and Johnson factory for.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0303.wav,X,3.2,3.4,4.2,1383,Male,Train," The elderly first, even if you have a relatively high vaccination rate, because in the middle of a wave, you can prevent more deaths by protecting the vulnerable."
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0304.wav,X,4.6,3.8,4.4,1383,Male,Train, So you can prevent more deaths by building up your herd protection to actually stop future waves.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0307.wav,X,4.0,3.6,4.2,1383,Male,Train, Alert and other contact tracing apps.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0312.wav,X,4.8,3.6,3.4,1383,Male,Train, Right. And we found that.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0315.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.0,1383,Male,Train, And you can actually reduce transmission very effectively.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0336.wav,X,4.6,4.8,4.6,1383,Male,Train, Have received their second doses of the vaccines.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0337.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.6,1383,Male,Train, Restrictions could lighten up. What do you think of these new models? Do you think?
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0340.wav,X,3.4,3.8,4.2,1383,Male,Train," This makes sense to me, and this is consistent with the outputs that our models have been producing."
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0366.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.6,1383,Male,Train, Then they'll have a much lower percentage vaccinated that they need.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0376.wav,X,3.4,3.4,4.0,1383,Male,Train," ICU admissions, hospitalizations, and those things will all start to decline because of the vaccine program."
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0413.wav,X,4.2,3.0,4.0,1383,Male,Train, And this B one hundred and eleven variant is perhaps the biggest variant of concern because it's so transmissible.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0415.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.6,1383,Male,Train, And also it seems to be more serious in terms of the infection.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0420.wav,X,2.6,3.2,3.4,1383,Male,Train," But we're already kind of dealing with V one hundred and seventeen, which."
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0424.wav,X,3.6,3.0,3.4,1383,Male,Train, Instead of flattening the curve. And despite uncertainties in the exact number of cases and exact death rate.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0426.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.6,1383,Male,Train, All that uncertainty if you reduce contacts.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0432.wav,X,4.2,2.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train, projections. And a great example of why that's important is.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0433.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.2,1383,Male,Train, is the power of exponential growth. And I can illustrate that with a story about a king.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0435.wav,X,2.6,3.4,3.6,1383,Male,Train, If he wished to reward this adviser for his years of service.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0436.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.4,1383,Male,Train," Visor, who is very canny and good at math."
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0440.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.4,1383,Male,Train," So four grains of rice in the third square, then eight sixty."
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0443.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train," And so he started putting the rice grains down, and then he quickly realized that he didn't have enough rice in the entire kingdom to satisfy the request."
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0450.wav,X,4.0,2.8,4.2,1383,Male,Train, Each infected person will infect around two and a half other persons on average.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0459.wav,X,4.2,3.0,4.2,1383,Male,Train, And this is one mistake that many public health authorities around the world have made again and again.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0463.wav,X,3.6,4.0,4.0,1383,Male,Train, And that's how countries like New Zealand and China have been able to do it more quite successfully is by acting soon.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0468.wav,X,3.8,4.2,3.8,1383,Male,Train, We have all the data from the last year that we can use to improve the model and make sure it's realistic.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0471.wav,X,3.6,3.2,4.4,1383,Male,Train," Okay, well what happens if we adjust the model so that we didn't lock down?"
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0474.wav,X,3.6,3.4,3.6,1383,Male,Train, Lockdown. Our results are showing that if we hadn't locked down it.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0479.wav,X,3.2,4.8,4.4,1383,Male,Train, So that shows that the lockdown had a huge impact in saving lots of lives in Ontario.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0487.wav,X,3.8,4.2,3.6,1383,Male,Train," You know, they were saving lives in the process and we wanted to show, you know, this is how many lives collectively we were able to save through these efforts."
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0491.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.6,1383,Male,Train, It's as scary as those second and third waves are.
MSP-PODCAST_2936_0492.wav,X,4.0,5.0,4.6,1383,Male,Train," It is sort of reassuring to know, at least, that it's coming as opposed to being surprised."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0106.wav,X,4.4,5.0,4.8,1383,Male,Train, I feel like three thousand dollars can really be the beginning of seed money.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0116.wav,X,4.4,4.6,4.6,1383,Male,Train, which showcases the stories of successful small businesses led by indigenous youth and nonprofits across the United States.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0118.wav,X,4.2,5.0,4.6,1383,Male,Train, I wanted to be a part of this program because.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0119.wav,X,3.0,4.6,4.4,1383,Male,Train," I felt like I had learned things along my journey that, you know, I wanted to share with indigenous students to help them start their businesses."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0124.wav,X,3.4,3.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train," Those channels that I, you know, I participated in."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0133.wav,X,3.0,3.4,3.8,1383,Male,Train, Even when you do mess up or when you don't get the contract signed that you wanted to do.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0134.wav,X,3.0,3.6,3.8,1383,Male,Train, You take a look at what happened and then you fix it and then you improve it and then you continue on your journey. And so it's learned.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0154.wav,X,3.4,5.0,4.4,1383,Male,Train, And so I wanted to be that person just to help share that message with the young people that.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0161.wav,X,4.4,4.6,3.8,1383,Male,Train, It's very community based. It's very community based.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0173.wav,X,4.0,5.0,3.6,1383,Male,Train, that I could connect with my community more.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0177.wav,X,3.8,4.6,4.4,1383,Male,Train," Kira, you're a member of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0182.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.2,1383,Male,Train, There's a lot of new business in Tyendenega.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0185.wav,X,5.0,4.8,4.2,1383,Male,Train, My boyfriend is a framer apprentice right now.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0201.wav,X,3.8,4.0,4.4,1383,Male,Train, Culture. Did that affect you at all or is this something that you've wanted to do?
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0203.wav,X,3.8,4.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train, I came because of the social development studies program.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0214.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train, And so I want to give back in that way.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0215.wav,X,3.4,5.4,4.4,1383,Male,Train," Um, and help others that need it."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0216.wav,X,3.6,4.4,4.0,1383,Male,Train, It's great. There are milestones that you have to hit or goals that you've got sort of set at certain points in this program.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0221.wav,X,4.2,5.0,4.2,1383,Male,Train," And so for month one, I did a value proposition."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0235.wav,X,3.6,4.6,4.6,1383,Male,Train, That was the best value proposition that I think I've heard in a long time.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0237.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.2,1383,Male,Train, Authentic. It was extremely close to home.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0241.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.4,1383,Male,Train," Now, not every indigenous entrepreneur lives in an indigenous country."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0245.wav,X,3.6,3.0,4.2,1383,Male,Train," Usually folks that live on reserve, they don't own their homes due to the Indian Act. And so it's hard to get loans large."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0247.wav,X,3.6,3.4,3.6,1383,Male,Train," Um, a line of credit to, you know, to help grow that seed even more."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0249.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.4,1383,Male,Train," And so yeah, that would probably be the biggest one."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0253.wav,X,3.8,3.4,3.4,1383,Male,Train," You know, saving everything that I can and I'm gonna go off"
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0254.wav,X,3.6,3.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train," reserve and buy a home, even though I have a home on reserve and I'm going to buy a home so I can establish that and that be able to"
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0261.wav,X,3.0,4.4,3.8,1383,Male,Train," You know, my roots and I thought that I, you know, this could be a bridge to help share my culture with the world and continue."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0269.wav,X,4.2,4.4,4.8,1383,Male,Train, Which is very admirable. And it's something that I.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0270.wav,X,3.2,4.6,4.4,1383,Male,Train, look forward to being able to implement in my own business.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0291.wav,X,4.0,3.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train, He has like two hundred thousand followers on his Instagram.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0294.wav,X,3.4,3.2,3.6,1383,Male,Train, And so I think it's so important to find folks that are not related.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0301.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.4,1383,Male,Train," You know, in the community and with more value, which."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0304.wav,X,3.6,3.4,3.8,1383,Male,Train," You know, you're able to do more things with that value, you know."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0315.wav,X,2.8,4.4,3.8,1383,Male,Train, Counsel and mentor others within the community who need help.
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0331.wav,X,3.6,4.4,3.4,1383,Male,Train," Self development and, you know, doing as much good as I can within the indigenous communities."
MSP-PODCAST_2937_0355.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.4,1383,Male,Train, and podcast wherever you get your podcasts and recommend this to your colleagues in Waterloo alumni.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0016.wav,X,3.4,5.0,4.2,1383,Male,Train, This piece of a piece of dirt just was just being lifted off in unison by all these.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0022.wav,X,4.6,5.2,4.4,1383,Male,Train," First, some good news on the pandemic front. On Tuesday, april."
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0039.wav,X,5.2,3.2,5.4,1383,Male,Train, The only individuals in a room or suite should be the residents who live there.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0132.wav,X,5.2,3.6,4.8,1383,Male,Train, It can also lead to the proliferation of wrong information and contribute to our uncertainty.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0138.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.8,1383,Male,Train," Helpful or even harmful to who's eligible for the vaccine, to other rules around social distancing and essential trips and things like that."
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0143.wav,X,5.0,3.6,4.8,1383,Male,Train," I think one of the reasons is that we don't have strong communication expertise in the provincial government, specifically in Ontario."
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0144.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.0,1383,Male,Train, So we don't have people who are creating a clear.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0145.wav,X,4.6,3.4,4.0,1383,Male,Train, structured communication strategy. So that's one really big problem.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0152.wav,X,4.6,3.4,4.6,1383,Male,Train, Is it possible that it's confusing just because the situation is changing rapidly?
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0155.wav,X,3.6,4.6,4.4,1383,Male,Train," But we are a year into the pandemic, and I would say that there's been a lot of opportunities for learning."
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0170.wav,X,4.6,3.6,4.8,1383,Male,Train, It just kind of creates this mental exhaustion.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0173.wav,X,3.8,3.0,4.0,1383,Male,Train, And one of the things that is making me quite disappointed in all that.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0187.wav,X,5.4,4.2,5.4,1383,Male,Train, So what's at risk or what are the consequences when we're in a crisis like a global pandemic?
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0190.wav,X,4.6,3.4,3.6,1383,Male,Train, I think the first one we can think about is actual the risk to public health.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0210.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.6,1383,Male,Train, It'd be a great way to disseminate information that is unambiguous.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0254.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.6,1383,Male,Train, The pandemic that I would like to see come back is every night on the Nightly News.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0278.wav,X,4.4,4.0,4.6,1383,Male,Train," Um, I think this is a really difficult question in some ways because."
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0298.wav,X,4.2,3.6,4.0,1383,Male,Train, One of the most pernicious parts of this is the fact that people are.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0301.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.4,1383,Male,Train, So one thing that I always appreciate that.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0314.wav,X,3.2,3.2,4.0,1383,Male,Train, It's not malicious. It's just sort of like perhaps the person is speaking without the best available facts.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0327.wav,X,4.8,3.8,4.6,1383,Male,Train," It becomes clickbaits, and that's a really easy way to implement disinformation."
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0340.wav,X,4.0,4.0,4.2,1383,Male,Train, That doesn't happen. So we can't fight this ourselves.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0365.wav,X,4.8,4.2,4.0,1383,Male,Train, Our social media platforms cater to us being reinforced in our belief systems.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0372.wav,X,4.4,3.4,4.4,1383,Male,Train, Social media and our consumption of it has produced quite a bit of divisiveness.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0387.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.6,1383,Male,Train," I mean, what is the best way to deal with that when you encounter that in your."
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0408.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.0,1383,Male,Train, It's just making the internet a worse place and it makes you have a less pleasant experience.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0409.wav,X,3.8,4.6,4.2,1383,Male,Train, And so that's where we need to rely on strong leadership and clear communication from our leaders to help.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0439.wav,X,4.4,5.2,4.6,1383,Male,Train, That kind of humor and make people feel connected based on that.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0454.wav,X,4.2,5.0,5.0,1383,Male,Train," Okay, good. What other points did you want to make, Shanna, about this topic?"
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0455.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.4,1383,Male,Train, Realize that the world is bigger than the way that social media portrays it.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0465.wav,X,4.6,4.8,4.4,1383,Male,Train, I'm very happy to see in the past couple of weeks is journalists have been pushing hard against their use of language and I've been very pleased to see that.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0470.wav,X,4.2,3.4,3.6,1383,Male,Train, Going forward. And I think that's how we keep them accountable.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0471.wav,X,5.0,5.2,5.0,1383,Male,Train, Wow. I was very pleased last week to be a part of the global engagement summit.
MSP-PODCAST_2938_0481.wav,X,4.4,4.6,4.4,1383,Male,Train, We're talking really about leadership and what good leadership should look like.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0023.wav,X,3.8,4.4,4.0,1383,Male,Train, Stories about the Muskovy duck that lived on campus for a time.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0074.wav,X,4.8,5.0,4.6,1383,Male,Train, It was for an annual increase of one percent.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0149.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.4,1383,Male,Train, We handle that. But then I also occasionally vaccinate as well.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0155.wav,X,4.2,4.0,3.8,1383,Male,Train, They're all going to be Pfizer vaccines because we need that bigger infrastructure to manage the Pfizer vaccine.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0165.wav,X,3.6,3.8,4.0,1383,Male,Train, So people in their nineties were the first ones to come to us and then people in their eighties and seventies.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0176.wav,X,4.0,4.2,4.2,1383,Male,Train, So we spent a lot of time trying to make it just an easy experience.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0189.wav,X,4.2,4.2,3.6,1383,Male,Train," As we get even more vaccine in, we should be up in the seven hundred."
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0202.wav,X,4.6,3.2,4.0,1383,Male,Train, There's people who want to be vaccinated three months ago.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0240.wav,X,4.4,5.0,4.6,1383,Male,Train, And this would probably be one of the biggest take homes I'd have for people in the media.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0252.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.4,1383,Male,Train, Absolutely. So I think just like any population.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0294.wav,X,3.8,4.2,3.6,1383,Male,Train, recognize someone when you go in. A lot of the volunteers at the clinic are University of Waterloo faculty and staff and retired folks from the universities and the
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0330.wav,X,4.8,2.8,3.8,1383,Male,Train, results to try and get a bit more money to test it in more people and they have to wait years. And it on and on it went.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0344.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.6,1383,Male,Train, Put so many resources into they ran these trials together.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0345.wav,X,4.666667,4.166667,4.666667,1383,Male,Train, It was transparent. Governments worked together.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0378.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.6,1383,Male,Train, But the whole process is that this is actually a system working in the way it was designed to work.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0389.wav,X,3.0,4.6,4.2,1383,Male,Train, So we have really robust systems that are set up to track drugs and vaccines.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0392.wav,X,3.0,3.6,4.2,1383,Male,Train, possible side effect with the AstraZeneca vaccine where in Europe they.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0401.wav,X,4.0,4.0,3.8,1383,Male,Train," In Canada, we had just started rolling it out, so we actually haven't seen these things yet."
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0413.wav,X,4.0,4.2,3.8,1383,Male,Train, Maybe three or four in a million at mold.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0414.wav,X,4.6,3.0,5.0,1383,Male,Train, To the fact that COVID itself is causing a lot of blood clots.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0428.wav,X,4.8,3.0,4.6,1383,Male,Train," But no, I mean, we aren't having like if we've got six hundred spots."
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0430.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.6,1383,Male,Train," So our region, what they've been doing is if you preregister and see if on the preregistration list, when you're eligible, they'll send out the invite to a line."
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0431.wav,X,4.0,4.6,3.8,1383,Male,Train, A lot of people. And we learned that you had to send it to a lot of people to fill those spots at the people.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0437.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.6,1383,Male,Train, Some people booking might have to wait a couple of weeks to get an appointment.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0442.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.4,1383,Male,Train, They have showed up at one hundred and thirty and depending on their frailty or their age.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0456.wav,X,3.8,3.2,3.6,1383,Male,Train, I have six hundred and forty doses and six hundred and forty people booked.
MSP-PODCAST_2939_0481.wav,X,4.0,4.6,4.0,1383,Male,Train, US is much further ahead than we are.

MSP-PODCAST_2960_0267.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.8,1404,Female,Train, Maybe who are then being held responsible and being forced to.
MSP-PODCAST_2960_0306.wav,X,3.0,3.4,3.8,1404,Female,Train, Is a big decision. The issue with parental leave is partly the grants that are offered that are not guaranteed.
MSP-PODCAST_2960_0329.wav,X,3.2,2.8,3.6,1404,Female,Train," With the pandemic, a lot of departments have completely frozen all sessional hirings."
MSP-PODCAST_2960_0356.wav,X,4.0,4.4,3.6,1402,Male,Train, And they're focused on the academic experience and the experience of graduate students.
MSP-PODCAST_2960_0368.wav,X,3.4,4.6,4.0,1402,Male,Train," They've endorsed our drive. Overwhelmingly, Council voted to approve."
MSP-PODCAST_2966_0336.wav,X,4.0,4.4,4.0,1533,Male,Train, And so we're making sure that everything we do from here on is completely up to date.
MSP-PODCAST_2966_0344.wav,X,3.0,3.4,3.6,1533,Male,Train, Faculty of Science and making sure that.
MSP-PODCAST_2966_0350.wav,X,3.2,4.2,4.0,1533,Male,Train, There's only so much that you can do to kind of help that circumstance.
MSP-PODCAST_2966_0359.wav,X,3.6,5.0,4.2,1533,Male,Train, I am hoping that more students can use this game and they can also kind of prepare themselves for when schools do reopen in person on how to keep.

MSP-PODCAST_2967_0104.wav,X,4.6,4.8,4.6,1533,Male,Train, The antibodies also work as a target for other mechanisms you have that will kill the virus.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0105.wav,X,4.8,3.8,5.0,1533,Male,Train," Particularly the macrophages, which are like amoeboid cells that chew it up and kill it."
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0108.wav,X,5.0,4.8,4.6,1533,Male,Train, Now your focus has been primarily fish and specifically the species of fish that we eat.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0132.wav,X,4.6,4.8,4.6,1533,Male,Train, Immune molecules that we can actually use as treatments to reduce that antibiotic use.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0135.wav,X,4.8,3.2,5.0,1533,Male,Train, It's hard to say whether they get more than say pigs or cattle or chicken would get.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0178.wav,X,4.8,3.2,4.6,1538,Female,Train, Measuring the immune status of fish and measuring molecules in fish blood.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0195.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.8,1538,Female,Train," Correct. But coronaviruses, the type of virus that COVID nineteen is caused by, are not very prevalent in blood."
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0215.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.6,1538,Female,Train, So we're looking for those specific antibodies that respond to the SARS COV two virus.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0216.wav,X,4.6,4.6,4.6,1538,Female,Train," And it's pretty easy to do because we just, we have a recombinant protein."
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0248.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.2,1538,Female,Train, So it may be that this person was infected just very quickly before we took the blood sample.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0265.wav,X,4.8,4.6,4.6,1538,Female,Train," If they have antibodies, does that automatically mean that they're immune?"
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0269.wav,X,4.8,3.6,4.4,1538,Female,Train, I haven't had enough time to test that because what has to happen is you have to develop antibodies and then get exposed to the virus again.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0278.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.2,1538,Female,Train, But the flip side of that is not too many people have got the disease.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0292.wav,X,4.8,3.6,4.6,1538,Female,Train, And that's the real question why we don't want to say people have antibodies are immune because we don't know what level you need on that. And it will take a minute.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0314.wav,X,4.0,4.6,4.0,1538,Female,Train, So you could just take that protein.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0351.wav,X,3.6,4.0,4.0,1538,Female,Train, We'll probably take until next March because it takes a lot of time to test all those things carefully.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0377.wav,X,3.8,2.8,4.4,1538,Female,Train, What's happening right now is everyone's so desperate for information that the instant someone does an experiment.
MSP-PODCAST_2967_0379.wav,X,4.0,3.8,4.4,1538,Female,Train, And then it turns out that it may not be correct because not everything was thought of and not everything was done correctly.

MSP-PODCAST_2968_0169.wav,X,2.8,3.2,3.0,1538,Female,Train, This is that website that tells you when the sun rises and when the moon sets and all of these things. And they actually have a night sky feature that they've added.
MSP-PODCAST_2968_0202.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.2,1449,Male,Train," I did look that far ahead and it's not going to be well placed sixty, eight hundred years from now either."

MSP-PODCAST_2968_0332.wav,X,3.2,4.2,3.8,1449,Male,Train, Is it unusual to get such an int a good photo of Saturn?
MSP-PODCAST_2968_0334.wav,X,2.4,3.8,3.6,1449,Male,Train, But the best times to take a photo of Saturn's rings actually happen every year by this phenomenon of opposition.
MSP-PODCAST_2968_0351.wav,X,5.0,5.0,4.6,1449,Male,Train," The rings of Saturn, they're actually almost pure ice to better than, you know, one."

MSP-PODCAST_2974_0378.wav,X,3.8,4.0,4.4,1572,Male,Train, So I just want to stress the fact that you have to stay true to your social circuit and bubble.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0184.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.2,1564,Female,Train, They are teaching multiple children sometimes who have different learning needs.

MSP-PODCAST_2978_0187.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.6,1564,Female,Train, We also know from a recent Angus Reed poll that came out on Monday that students aren't liking this either.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0192.wav,X,3.6,4.6,4.6,1564,Female,Train, But also for students sense of confidence and love of learning.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0196.wav,X,4.0,3.6,4.4,1564,Female,Train, has long really been discredited for learning. Learning is something that's really active and creative.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0210.wav,X,4.6,4.4,4.4,1564,Female,Train, So the idea that we need to have connection is an important one.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0234.wav,X,4.8,4.8,4.2,1564,Female,Train, teachers. And I think that that is warranted in some ways.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0236.wav,X,5.0,4.2,4.2,1564,Female,Train," Really on student wellbeing, or perhaps teachers are providing supports for individual students who are struggling the most."
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0238.wav,X,4.2,3.4,4.2,1564,Female,Train," As usual, give permission to parents to be opting out of this."
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0255.wav,X,3.8,2.8,4.2,1564,Female,Train, We're not going to be able to replicate that connection that happens in the classroom.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0262.wav,X,4.4,5.0,4.6,1564,Female,Train," It is a really important initiative and again, allowing for teachers to do what they see fit for."
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0270.wav,X,4.4,3.2,4.4,1564,Female,Train, So they're teaching their own children at home and dealing with those stresses.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0274.wav,X,5.2,3.2,4.8,1564,Female,Train, as does the Ministry of Education of what is education going to look like when we return.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0297.wav,X,4.0,3.0,4.4,1564,Female,Train, Absence from schools doesn't lead to such large learning gaps that we can't think about the ways that we can overcome that in the fall.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0303.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.0,1564,Female,Train, There's just such little knowledge about how young people can be affected by COVID nineteen or how they can spread this disease.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0310.wav,X,3.6,3.2,3.8,1564,Female,Train, This kind of pause is warranted in this unprecedented time.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0315.wav,X,3.8,4.6,4.6,1564,Female,Train, You were sort of describing what's happening in France as well.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0316.wav,X,3.8,3.6,3.6,1564,Female,Train, So it's staggered. They can't all be interacting with their friends.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0337.wav,X,3.6,3.0,4.4,1564,Female,Train, You can't squish more students into learning.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0339.wav,X,5.2,3.8,4.0,1564,Female,Train, And that actually requires a lower student to teacher ratio.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0345.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.6,1564,Female,Train, learning. I think what this has taught us
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0349.wav,X,4.2,3.4,4.4,1564,Female,Train, connections that sustain learning and teachers know this.
MSP-PODCAST_2978_0350.wav,X,3.8,3.8,4.4,1564,Female,Train, Teachers know that the social and emotional supports they provide in a classroom are in essence the focus of what they do in a classroom.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0216.wav,X,3.2,4.0,3.6,1565,Male,Train," You know, social distancing implies that we're being distant from our social relationships or we're somehow putting a pause on our social relationships, which."
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0241.wav,X,3.2,4.0,3.4,1565,Male,Train, We're relying to a great deal on what we know from past influenza epidemics. H one N one.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0251.wav,X,2.8,3.8,4.0,1565,Male,Train, And so the two meters is just a precaution.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0290.wav,X,4.0,3.2,4.0,1565,Male,Train, So we're having to rely on these kind of measures.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0291.wav,X,2.8,4.0,3.8,1565,Male,Train, And once we get to a point where we are seeing the number of cases flatten out.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0300.wav,X,3.2,4.4,4.0,1565,Male,Train, It requires us to be able to test and to test quickly.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0302.wav,X,3.6,4.2,3.8,1565,Male,Train," Once people are identified as being infected, to get to their immediate contacts in particular."
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0314.wav,X,3.6,2.6,4.2,1565,Male,Train," We're very much blind with regard to how this disease is being transmitted through the community. Because we don't really know, we're going to try everything we possibly can."
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0324.wav,X,2.6,3.0,3.8,1565,Male,Train, And if we see any glimmer of a sudden uptick in infections.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0325.wav,X,4.2,2.4,3.4,1565,Male,Train, So the real danger is that we're going to experience a second surge and then we're going to be back just where we started all over again.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0339.wav,X,3.8,3.4,3.8,1565,Male,Train," essentially acknowledging that yeah, we have room for you in our ICUs."
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0355.wav,X,3.8,3.2,3.8,1565,Male,Train," So, so the disease will not be very efficiently transmitted."
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0362.wav,X,2.8,3.6,3.2,1565,Male,Train," Of course, we don't want to infect everybody in order to achieve herd immunity."
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0411.wav,X,2.6,4.0,3.8,1565,Male,Train, privilege to be able to do this. Other places in the world cannot do this.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0416.wav,X,3.6,3.8,4.2,1565,Male,Train," There are some studies out there done by some sort of physicists and so forth that suggest that, you know, if you're in someone's slipstream and they're infected and they're."
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0424.wav,X,4.2,3.6,5.0,1565,Male,Train, Very low. I think getting outside is is what we all should be doing.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0462.wav,X,3.0,3.2,3.6,1565,Male,Train, It's a lot easier if you're hiking a trail or biking a bike path or something like that.
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0465.wav,X,3.0,4.4,3.6,1565,Male,Train," You know, summer park employees back to work to help enforce that social distancing and that sort of thing."
MSP-PODCAST_2979_0468.wav,X,3.4,4.8,4.0,1565,Male,Train," And it's become a little bit more normative, I see."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0212.wav,X,3.8,4.0,3.8,1567,Male,Train, And so they assume that they blame other people who don't deal with it as effectively as they do.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0236.wav,X,4.0,3.2,5.2,1567,Male,Train, One of the biggest things that I think people are feeling is constraint.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0238.wav,X,4.6,3.6,4.8,1567,Male,Train, Then that's also a pretty big driver of boredom.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0252.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.2,1567,Male,Train, And it looks like self esteem at time one predicts boredom at time two and what?
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0281.wav,X,3.8,4.6,3.4,1567,Male,Train, no progress. And I think that we're having we're having.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0285.wav,X,4.2,3.8,4.4,1567,Male,Train, And this might sort of peg me as actually being the boring person I don't.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0287.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.2,1567,Male,Train," You know, if you think about our lives pre pandemic."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0289.wav,X,4.0,3.0,3.4,1567,Male,Train, You go to work for about the same period each day.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0295.wav,X,5.0,3.8,4.6,1567,Male,Train," You could say, well, my life before the pandemic was kind of mundane."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0301.wav,X,5.4,4.0,5.2,1567,Male,Train, What's changed is you can't just shake it up if you're.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0308.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.2,1567,Male,Train," I don't think that's really, I think that's too easy an explanation."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0310.wav,X,5.0,4.4,4.6,1567,Male,Train," And that actually came out, it was really interesting. People are ramping up their studies of this kind of stuff really quickly."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0315.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.2,1567,Male,Train," And among other things, it asked people during the experience of the lockdown in Italy."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0327.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.4,1567,Male,Train, Because sometimes you don't want to actively seek out some goals.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0368.wav,X,5.4,5.0,4.8,1567,Male,Train, But it satisfied my boredom in that moment because I just I was choosing.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0371.wav,X,4.2,4.8,4.4,1567,Male,Train, Passively letting yourself be filled will work for a little while.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0386.wav,X,5.333333,3.333333,4.833333,1567,Male,Train," have a really, really strong need."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0403.wav,X,5.0,4.6,4.6,1567,Male,Train, We make a distinction between the in the moment feelings.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0408.wav,X,4.8,4.4,4.6,1567,Male,Train, straight boredom proneness. And so what that's referring to is just individual differences in how often and how intensely you feel bored.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0411.wav,X,4.8,3.8,4.6,1567,Male,Train, It's associated with a lot of challenges to mental health. We know.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0413.wav,X,4.6,3.4,4.4,1567,Male,Train, We know that boredom is strongly related to correlated with depression.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0414.wav,X,4.6,4.0,4.6,1567,Male,Train, And that's actually something I'm in the process of trying to put together a grant to look at that because we've known about this for a very long time.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0418.wav,X,4.8,4.0,4.6,1567,Male,Train, And it's associated with a range of other mental health challenges.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0427.wav,X,3.6,3.4,4.2,1567,Male,Train, We know that highly boredom prone people are also more likely to have problems with alcohol and drugs of addiction.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0428.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.2,1567,Male,Train, There's some hint that problem gambling is associated with high boredom proneness and some really interesting work coming out of a guy called John Alhai and.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0449.wav,X,4.6,4.6,4.2,1567,Male,Train," So Chris was one of these people that said only boring people get bored. And then, and we tell this story in the book."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0450.wav,X,4.2,3.8,3.8,1567,Male,Train," But then, you know, you probe a little bit further and you find out, no."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0456.wav,X,5.0,4.8,4.8,1567,Male,Train," You could see that you were making a difference and that your actions were working, right?"
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0457.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.4,1567,Male,Train, And then he talked about he used to really hate doing something called harrowing.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0459.wav,X,4.4,3.4,5.0,1567,Male,Train, It's breaking up big bits of dirt into smaller bits of dirt. And he said he didn't like that because in front of you was a brown field and behind you was a.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0471.wav,X,4.0,4.6,4.2,1567,Male,Train," Lebedev, which is a Russian cosmonaut."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0474.wav,X,4.4,3.8,4.2,1567,Male,Train," You know, some people more bored than are prone to boredom than others."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0494.wav,X,3.8,3.2,3.8,1567,Male,Train," Okay, what would work for me now? What?"
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0496.wav,X,4.2,4.4,3.8,1567,Male,Train, Whether or not that winds up being baking a cake or.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0502.wav,X,4.4,3.6,4.8,1567,Male,Train," Listen to it and say, okay, and ultimately that might mean that what you do is nothing."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0504.wav,X,4.6,4.8,5.0,1567,Male,Train, I think we should be okay with allowing ourselves to not do much in that sort of moment.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0516.wav,X,5.0,3.0,5.0,1567,Male,Train, Probably we were in routines beforehand. And what's really been lost here is our sense of control that we can do what we want to do whenever we want.
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0517.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.6,1567,Male,Train," to do it, but also a sense of routine and structures."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0518.wav,X,4.4,3.8,4.8,1567,Male,Train," There are structures and routines that we had pre pandemic, and they mattered, and we probably just ignored them."
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0521.wav,X,4.8,3.4,4.8,1567,Male,Train," And with that loss of predictiveness or predictability, I think comes a sort of sense of, well, what?"
MSP-PODCAST_2981_0533.wav,X,5.2,5.0,5.2,1567,Male,Train," To occupy myself, occupy my mind and have positive interactions, given the constraints."
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0141.wav,X,4.6,4.4,4.4,1568,Female,Train, So I find that what's happening right now is that one of the main concerns is that we're getting a lot of our news from social media platforms.
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0143.wav,X,4.4,3.6,4.4,1568,Female,Train, One is misinformation. So we're seeing a lot of information going around about health and how to cure COVID and what the symptoms are that are not true.
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0145.wav,X,4.4,3.2,4.6,1568,Female,Train," circulating misinformation right now through our use of social media. Another thing that I think is a problem is that with things like Twitter,"
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0147.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.2,1568,Female,Train, Which on one hand are great because we need to stay connected as a kind of large global community.
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0171.wav,X,4.8,4.2,4.6,1568,Female,Train," The other thing, and this is what you're speaking to, but your experience on the weekend, was that it's an emotional feedback loop, and it can be very unsettling."
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0223.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.4,1568,Female,Train, App that's generally used for like handheld devices like phones and tablets mostly.
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0300.wav,X,4.0,5.2,4.2,1568,Female,Train," Facebook Messenger, there's Facebook Messenger for kids. And, you know, it's actually good because it goes through your parental Facebook account."
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0353.wav,X,4.4,4.8,4.8,1568,Female,Train," I think at this moment in time, to the best of our abilities with our work schedules and whatever duties we have."
MSP-PODCAST_2982_0355.wav,X,3.6,3.4,4.2,1568,Female,Train, is really helpful in letting us adjust to this kind of new reality.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0006.wav,X,2.8,3.4,3.6,1569,Male,Train, There was trouble. I'd gotten in with a few guys who were smuggling pain pills all up and down the coast.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0008.wav,X,3.8,3.4,3.6,1569,Male,Train, I woke up one afternoon on the boat and suddenly it felt like I had maybe an hour to jump ship and get the hell out of there.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0009.wav,X,2.0,2.8,3.0,1569,Male,Train, I was terrified. I was twenty two.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0020.wav,X,2.4,3.2,2.6,1569,Male,Train, So I freaked out and I snuck off.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0021.wav,X,2.8,4.0,3.6,1569,Male,Train, I started walking down a dirt road in the dark at like two in the morning.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0033.wav,X,2.6,4.2,3.8,1569,Male,Train, I left the road and sat at the edge of a huge field under the stars one day.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0042.wav,X,2.6,3.6,3.4,1569,Male,Train, They sounded like flutes almost that would start and stop and rise and fall.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0059.wav,X,2.6,4.0,3.4,1569,Male,Train," I felt safe. I walked right up to the police, across a bumpy brick patio."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0062.wav,X,2.6,3.0,3.2,1569,Male,Train," Warm light inside, so I walked right in."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0066.wav,X,2.6,4.4,4.6,1572,Male,Train," And a chandelier and everything was red and brown and oak and gold, art on the walls."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0069.wav,X,2.0,2.0,3.4,1569,Male,Train," But instead, there were dead people in it."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0070.wav,X,3.0,2.2,4.4,1569,Male,Train, There were dead people in it lying on the carpet.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0071.wav,X,2.2,3.0,2.2,1569,Male,Train," I think seven or eight of them lying there on their sides, on their stomachs."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0075.wav,X,3.2,2.2,4.6,1569,Male,Train," I would have run, but at first I couldn't be sure what I was seeing."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0079.wav,X,3.6,3.4,5.2,1572,Male,Train, crawled inside their skin and then.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0080.wav,X,2.6,3.4,3.2,1569,Male,Train, Painted them with light blue streaks from underneath it.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0098.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.6,1571,Male,Train," to write. Even at twenty two, I'd already learned."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0105.wav,X,2.2,3.6,3.6,1572,Male,Train, So he kept coming. He came all the way down.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0113.wav,X,2.6,3.2,3.2,1569,Male,Train," peaceful, chin up like he was soaking in the rays of the chandelier."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0125.wav,X,3.8,3.0,3.6,1569,Male,Train," What with doctor Penny filling their heads with all kinds of weird philosophies, drugs too."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0127.wav,X,2.2,4.6,4.6,1572,Male,Train, And then one day they'd captured the prisoner.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0129.wav,X,2.8,2.8,3.6,1569,Male,Train," I've forgotten them, started to really lose their minds."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0132.wav,X,2.2,4.0,3.2,1572,Male,Train," Even doctor Penny, who had worked for ten years to catch one."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0137.wav,X,2.8,3.6,4.6,1572,Male,Train, He hid. He saw people come into his room.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0163.wav,X,2.2,2.8,3.8,1572,Male,Train," slaughterhouse or something, an echo every time I moved."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0164.wav,X,3.2,4.0,3.8,1569,Male,Train," And up ahead, a big raised square."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0177.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.8,1569,Male,Train," It was a flashlight, a big heavy duty thing."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0185.wav,X,2.8,3.0,3.6,1569,Male,Train, But it died before it hit anything.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0191.wav,X,2.6,2.8,3.2,1569,Male,Train, I didn't know what I was supposed to be seeing or hearing.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0209.wav,X,2.6,2.6,3.2,1569,Male,Train," a bald human head, but"
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0221.wav,X,3.2,3.8,3.6,1569,Male,Train, There was no point in keeping it shut anymore.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0228.wav,X,2.2,3.2,2.8,1569,Male,Train," silvery looking. If I'd been listening more carefully when I came in,"
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0240.wav,X,2.8,3.2,3.2,1569,Male,Train," She was shy, or maybe didn't want to see what was going on around her."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0245.wav,X,3.0,2.4,3.8,1569,Male,Train, I went to the front door and I opened it. This side of the house bordered woods and fields too.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0254_0002.wav,X,1.8,4.4,3.4,1571,Male,Train," And in the distance, those tall mountains that were nothing but"
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0263.wav,X,4.2,3.2,4.4,1569,Male,Train, His whole neck was blue.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0276.wav,X,3.6,3.0,3.8,1569,Male,Train, I had no desire to stumble around blindly in this foreign land.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0282.wav,X,3.0,3.8,4.4,1569,Male,Train, I remember this fine silent spray that barely even soaked my clothes.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0290.wav,X,2.8,3.8,3.6,1571,Male,Train, we'd been traveling almost parallel to each other.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0301.wav,X,2.2,2.6,3.8,1571,Male,Train, The prisoner began to turn.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0329.wav,X,2.4,2.8,4.0,1569,Male,Train," dissipating, and the prisoner began to fall."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0331.wav,X,3.4,3.0,3.6,1569,Male,Train," Two times, I slipped and slammed into the ground just like the panicky victim in some horror movie."
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0334.wav,X,2.8,2.4,4.8,1569,Male,Train, I ran back through the orchard past my host's corpse.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0337.wav,X,3.0,3.2,4.0,1569,Male,Train, My shirt and my pants soaked and muddy.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0347.wav,X,3.6,2.6,4.0,1572,Male,Train, Including one body in a wheelchair.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0373.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.8,1569,Male,Train, And who would know to look for the signs of something enormous
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0374.wav,X,3.0,2.6,3.6,1569,Male,Train, having been dragged away by something of
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0385.wav,X,2.6,3.0,3.4,1569,Male,Train, I'm fifty two now. I live in Jersey City.
MSP-PODCAST_2983_0388.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.6,1569,Male,Train, They bend just so.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0008.wav,X,3.6,4.0,4.4,1577,Male,Train, And my eyes went to a certain line and I said.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0009.wav,X,3.4,2.8,3.8,1577,Male,Train," Wait, Bree, what's this? She said."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0020.wav,X,4.4,3.0,4.0,1577,Male,Train, Now we owed that six hundred thousand dollars and it had to be paid.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0022.wav,X,3.2,2.6,3.4,1577,Male,Train, It was about projections and budgeting and the CFO was about to be made to look very stupid.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0027.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.8,1577,Male,Train," She said, What's wrong? Your face is red and blotchy."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0044.wav,X,5.2,2.8,5.2,1577,Male,Train, Of can't. I can't. This is not why my mother.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0059.wav,X,3.8,3.0,4.2,1578,Female,Train," Curving up the coast, you start to see the real wealth."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0080.wav,X,3.4,3.0,3.8,1578,Female,Train, And even then you need paddle tires.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0149.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.6,1577,Male,Train, And covered it up and looked up at the stars.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0185.wav,X,2.2,3.4,3.0,1580,Male,Train," I tracked down one of this guy's books and read it, and it was pretty good."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0204.wav,X,4.2,2.6,4.2,1577,Male,Train, I started to fear for my sanity a little because I'd gotten.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0230.wav,X,3.0,2.8,4.4,1577,Male,Train, thirtieth. I saw something really disturbing today.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0233.wav,X,2.4,3.2,3.0,1577,Male,Train," A mass of gulls squawking, but I couldn't see them."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0237.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.0,1577,Male,Train, Looking at me. The only person I've seen out here since I got dropped off.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0239.wav,X,2.8,4.0,3.6,1577,Male,Train, Great raincoat looked like one anyway.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0244.wav,X,2.6,2.8,3.4,1577,Male,Train, he turned and walked away.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0250.wav,X,3.6,4.0,4.4,1577,Male,Train, I think this was the strangest thing I've ever seen.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0376.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.4,1578,Female,Train," I told her I was due to pick him up for a supply run on Monday, but."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0384.wav,X,3.6,3.2,4.2,1578,Female,Train," When he got old, he started to fade."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0390.wav,X,3.4,2.6,3.8,1578,Female,Train, Downhill from there. Kind of.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0445.wav,X,2.8,2.8,3.4,1577,Male,Train," So bitter. Now it's still cold, but."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0451.wav,X,3.0,3.4,3.8,1577,Male,Train, I still can't quite shake my fear of the dark.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0452.wav,X,3.0,3.2,3.6,1577,Male,Train, I wonder if I stayed forever if I ever would.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0464.wav,X,4.4,2.6,4.6,1578,Female,Train, put there when the fishing wars got violent in the nineteen twenties.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0466.wav,X,4.4,2.8,5.0,1578,Female,Train," It just went on and on, culture after culture, doing terrible things and all the traces just wiped out."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0468.wav,X,3.0,4.4,3.8,1578,Female,Train, That's where the one Land Rover I like most was in the repair bay.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0472.wav,X,4.8,2.8,4.6,1578,Female,Train, There's no sense in ploughing into the dunes in the dark until you absolutely have to.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0491.wav,X,2.2,3.4,3.4,1572,Male,Train, He even turned off the radio.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0616.wav,X,3.6,2.8,4.2,1578,Female,Train, That's for goddamn sure. Doesn't pay to get too curious out here.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0623.wav,X,4.2,5.2,4.2,1578,Female,Train," Especially in the dark, you've got to have some real skill to not get stuck."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0628.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.8,1578,Female,Train," Very neat. And there was actually a radio playing, a battery powered one."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0634.wav,X,3.2,2.8,3.8,1578,Female,Train," I started to reason with him, but."
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0710.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.8,1577,Male,Train, were turning around. I thought it must have been Lydia.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0737.wav,X,3.4,3.2,3.8,1572,Male,Train, Or he was wearing a mask or something.
MSP-PODCAST_2984_0800.wav,X,5.2,4.2,4.8,1580,Male,Train, Not delusional. I think the only reason I'm still here is because it wasn't full dark when I saw it.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0005.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.4,1570,Male,Train, Fifth floor and there's no elevator.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0010.wav,X,3.2,4.2,3.8,1570,Male,Train, He met me down in the lobby to sign the papers.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0015.wav,X,4.8,3.4,5.0,1570,Male,Train, You put your social security number on the right line.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0018.wav,X,3.0,2.8,3.6,1570,Male,Train, Never heard of them. So this is gonna be my first night in the city.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0039.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.4,1570,Male,Train," Graffiti strewn dumpster, that's just not a scene I've been to for too long."
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0072.wav,X,2.4,4.4,3.6,1570,Male,Train," Except. Whoa. Okay, this is interesting."
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0076.wav,X,3.8,2.8,4.4,1570,Male,Train, It is a Bible. I'm the one who put it into the trash like eight hours ago.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0090.wav,X,2.8,2.8,3.6,1570,Male,Train, Write you passive aggressive freak. If it didn't occur to you to donate it or give it away.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0103.wav,X,4.0,3.6,3.6,1570,Male,Train, I'll call the cable company here in a bit so I can have the internet hooked up.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0105.wav,X,3.6,2.8,3.8,1570,Male,Train, It feels like I'm living in the turn of the century instead of twenty eighteen.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0115.wav,X,3.0,2.8,3.8,1570,Male,Train," Just in a, I did notice the calendar had changed in the last fifty years."
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0117.wav,X,2.0,3.0,2.6,1570,Male,Train, Definitely overkill. It's like forty five outside. She said to me.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0183.wav,X,3.0,4.4,4.0,1570,Male,Train, What I've been doing is traversing each floor to take a look around.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0198.wav,X,3.6,2.8,4.2,1570,Male,Train," But then, since, like a lot of people, I've wasted half my life watching horror movies."
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0219.wav,X,2.6,3.0,3.2,1570,Male,Train," But I looked down, down near where the dumpster is."
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0224.wav,X,2.6,3.2,3.4,1570,Male,Train, The alligator woman. She was looking right up at my window.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0225.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.0,1570,Male,Train," I swear to God, she saw me."
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0227.wav,X,1.8,3.0,3.0,1570,Male,Train, Sad. And we kind of held eye contact and then she turned and she got into the car.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0293.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.6,1570,Male,Train, And Dennis was in there.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0330.wav,X,2.4,3.2,3.0,1570,Male,Train, It was her. It was the woman.
MSP-PODCAST_2985_0418.wav,X,3.2,3.0,3.8,1570,Male,Train," I swear, just standing here again."
MSP-PODCAST_2986_0036.wav,X,2.8,3.6,3.6,1572,Male,Train," And, ever optimistic, they refused to entertain offers."
MSP-PODCAST_2986_0085.wav,X,3.2,3.2,4.2,1572,Male,Train," Nung, the older one, brash and boastful."
MSP-PODCAST_2986_0271.wav,X,2.8,3.0,3.0,1572,Male,Train, I finally came to Echo Town.
MSP-PODCAST_2986_0357.wav,X,2.2,2.4,2.6,1572,Male,Train," He said, we are very ashamed this happened."
MSP-PODCAST_2991_0661.wav,X,4.2,3.2,3.6,1479,Female,Train," Um, there was an incident I still don't understand."
MSP-PODCAST_2991_0784.wav,X,2.6,5.0,3.8,1479,Female,Train, But I felt safer somehow calling the number on the card first.

MSP-PODCAST_3001_0817.wav,X,5.2,2.8,5.0,1014,Female,Train," Hey, I was just, but what's the big deal?"
MSP-PODCAST_3001_1079_0000.wav,X,2.8,3.2,4.8,1014,Female,Train, Is I was hungry?
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0006.wav,X,2.4,3.8,2.2,1014,Female,Train," overlooked, misunderstood, and even feared. And bisexuality tends to be one that does get overlooked."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0048.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.0,1014,Female,Train," Uh, coyotes? Hello?"
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0054.wav,X,3.8,3.0,4.2,1014,Female,Train, Are you always able to stop nature in its tracks?
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0066.wav,X,3.2,4.0,2.4,1014,Female,Train," Can, um, can I, can I pedal?"
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0103.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.4,1014,Female,Train, They are they look confused and maybe a little bit scared.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0137.wav,X,3.8,4.0,3.2,1014,Female,Train, pan today and don't wanna.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0168.wav,X,2.8,3.0,4.0,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, the corrupted growth of nature."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0169.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.2,1014,Female,Train," If I remember right, that sounds like his doing."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0201.wav,X,3.6,3.4,3.8,1014,Female,Train, That would probably be for the best.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0204.wav,X,2.8,2.8,2.8,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, you're probably right. Sorry."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0207.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.0,1014,Female,Train," How to how to work with it to uh,"
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0230.wav,X,3.0,4.2,3.2,1014,Female,Train, Not by use. They lead up just a kind of a small hillside that's cleared from the brush around it.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0242.wav,X,3.4,4.2,3.4,1014,Female,Train, But they have stretched from the top of the stairs.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0286.wav,X,4.6,4.2,4.2,1014,Female,Train," There was a log up top that was, but it was old and broken down at one."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0380.wav,X,2.6,4.2,3.6,1014,Female,Train, So Ned is going to reach into his Dora the Explorer backpack.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0488.wav,X,3.6,3.2,4.2,1014,Female,Train, We get to the top of the stairs and it's kind of empty.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0600.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.4,1014,Female,Train," The box turns into like a little hot wheels car, zips over to the raccoon."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0628.wav,X,2.2,4.4,3.2,1014,Female,Train," Uh, one question. I guess I'm split between where."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0653.wav,X,2.4,4.2,3.0,1014,Female,Train, Sort of like you have applied a filter to the environment on the other through this log.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0669.wav,X,4.2,3.8,3.6,1014,Female,Train, I don't know why but for some reason.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0701.wav,X,4.2,4.4,3.4,1014,Female,Train," I think, I guess worst instinct is best instinct, right?"
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0704.wav,X,3.6,3.4,3.2,1014,Female,Train," But yeah. And so Kenneth, I."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0756.wav,X,3.2,3.8,3.8,1014,Female,Train, You said that everything here is kind of washed out.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0760.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.2,1014,Female,Train, But you are the most colorful thing in the area.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0785.wav,X,3.2,3.6,3.0,1014,Female,Train," more consistently. I, you're still standing upon vines because I may have under"
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0787.wav,X,3.2,4.0,4.0,1014,Female,Train, But it's covering essentially everything. It's not stretching up the church as far.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0803.wav,X,3.6,4.4,3.8,1014,Female,Train, And then he walks back over.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0805.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.0,1014,Female,Train," It's, uh, we're in a weird place here."
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0843.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.0,1014,Female,Train, It can't change.
MSP-PODCAST_3002_0890.wav,X,2.8,2.6,3.4,1014,Female,Train, He's never coming back. And this is what we have to live with now.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0005.wav,X,2.8,4.8,3.4,1014,Female,Train, There's a physical community in Seattle and also lots of virtual services that you can find online through them as well.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0033.wav,X,3.2,4.2,3.6,1014,Female,Train, Wait we gave Schuyler's legs their own seat at the table.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0044.wav,X,2.4,3.6,3.6,1014,Female,Train," I mean, you guys can use our pancake stuff. We got like flour and that. It's it's all right."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0115.wav,X,4.2,5.0,4.0,1014,Female,Train, Like forcing a smile very innocently.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0119.wav,X,3.4,3.0,3.0,1014,Female,Train," Okay, that's abnormal, but as long as you woke up, I."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0127.wav,X,5.4,2.8,4.6,1014,Female,Train," Uh, No, I don't. I don't know."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0129.wav,X,4.4,3.8,3.4,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, I'm sorry. My mind's just."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0142.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.6,1014,Female,Train," mister Clock and I were talking about thirty two forty,"
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0149.wav,X,2.8,3.4,4.2,1014,Female,Train, It tends to be that whenever one has less power the other.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0168.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.2,1014,Female,Train," Right? I guess I'm not really sure how these power dynamics work. Abel, yeah."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0173.wav,X,2.8,4.0,3.4,1014,Female,Train," Look, if we have no evidence that we could even see pan, that"
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0185.wav,X,3.4,4.2,4.2,1014,Female,Train, You feel a small pain rising in your abdomen.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0194.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.4,1014,Female,Train," Your deal with Yaldabath, right?"
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0203.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.8,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, and if it's if those legs are hurting you."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0226.wav,X,4.8,3.2,4.2,1014,Female,Train," I don't know how that happens. But I don't know, I'm just."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0272.wav,X,3.0,3.4,3.8,1014,Female,Train," Your only way now, if you're gonna take out."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0287.wav,X,3.6,3.2,3.8,1014,Female,Train, I was wondering why they were attacking us.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0289.wav,X,4.0,3.4,3.8,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, Your coyotes seem to be under the influence"
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0293.wav,X,3.6,4.2,3.8,1014,Female,Train," does, but I can't do anything about it. I"
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0305.wav,X,3.8,4.4,4.2,1014,Female,Train, And coyote that seems to back away from within the watch.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0311.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.2,1014,Female,Train," So yeah, just just get all that done and have fun with all your unholy communications with the Aldubad."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0329.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.6,1014,Female,Train, If Yaldaboth controls the coyotes.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0337.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.0,1014,Female,Train, Maybe I could find those same coyotes and try out some spells or see if they'll even listen to me.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0419.wav,X,3.4,3.0,3.4,1014,Female,Train, I'm having trouble with restraint.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0422.wav,X,4.0,5.0,4.0,1014,Female,Train, Black eggs and I can eat them and I get a little bit better.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0441.wav,X,3.0,4.2,3.2,1014,Female,Train," Um, circular. It's now about the size of a golf ball."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0512.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.2,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, my bad, um, don't give the egg to the bucket."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0527.wav,X,5.6,5.0,5.4,1014,Female,Train," Ah, oh my God. Okay. Okay."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0528.wav,X,3.8,3.6,3.2,1014,Female,Train," Um, maybe, um, mm, I feel like it's gonna be just as bad if Skylar eats the egg right?"
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0558.wav,X,3.4,4.8,4.4,1014,Female,Train, We also started to branch out into more topics than I expected to.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0622.wav,X,2.8,3.4,3.4,1014,Female,Train, We've established in the past was a leading conservationist of the area and park ranger.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0651.wav,X,3.4,3.0,3.8,1014,Female,Train," Well, Grandpa Rick wasn't born until nineteen twenty four."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0656.wav,X,4.0,3.4,2.8,1014,Female,Train, I'd feel more comfortable. I'm gonna go get the little buddies out of my room real quick.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0659.wav,X,2.8,3.2,2.8,1014,Female,Train, laying on the floor and they're asleep.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0674.wav,X,3.0,4.5,3.666667,1014,Female,Train, A past life has something useful to offer.
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0718.wav,X,2.4,5.4,3.2,1014,Female,Train," Oh, shoot. Thanks, Grandpa Rick."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0759.wav,X,3.6,3.6,4.0,1014,Female,Train," Guys, I think we need to go to that staircase."
MSP-PODCAST_3003_0784.wav,X,2.6,3.4,3.2,1014,Female,Train, Fog is quickly upon you and you will be dealing with this fog as you continue forward into the woodlands.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0043.wav,X,4.4,5.0,4.0,1014,Female,Train, Eggs are starting to grow in.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0046.wav,X,4.0,4.6,3.8,1014,Female,Train, So the coyotes and other animals.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0066.wav,X,3.6,4.4,2.8,1014,Female,Train, Yes. I would like to take the book with me. So I will walk up to the pulpit and like pick up the book.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0082.wav,X,2.8,3.8,3.4,1014,Female,Train, They head off in their own directions and then the two coyotes are trying to direct you somewhere.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0123.wav,X,3.6,4.0,3.6,1014,Female,Train, So you first open up the book to the page that had been bookmarked with like the piece of ribbon that is within the binding of the book.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0126.wav,X,3.2,3.8,3.8,1014,Female,Train, You're not able to understand what you see in front of you.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0129.wav,X,3.0,3.0,3.2,1014,Female,Train, It's just something that you don't understand.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0136.wav,X,3.6,4.2,3.6,1014,Female,Train," Uh, Where's everyone? Ned's house. I'll go to Ned's house."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0148.wav,X,4.4,4.4,4.2,1014,Female,Train," I mean, it feels weird to just let Bigfoot run away."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0150.wav,X,4.0,2.6,4.0,1014,Female,Train," Like, I don't even need to deal with that, man."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0158.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.2,1014,Female,Train, But I think now is one of those times because I think maybe we need to get back to the others and tell them about how bad our night was.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0166.wav,X,4.8,4.2,4.4,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, this big foot could be creeping on me at any point in time and I would have no idea."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0179.wav,X,3.2,3.0,3.0,1014,Female,Train," Got it. Well, I mean."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0202.wav,X,3.0,3.4,3.6,1014,Female,Train, I was really tired when they were discussing that and I wasn't really paying attention.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0204.wav,X,3.2,2.8,2.8,1014,Female,Train," Uh, meta aside. Did we agree to meet back at the normal house?"
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0219.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.6,1014,Female,Train," I will summarize my research. Episode two, I."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0238.wav,X,3.6,3.2,3.8,1014,Female,Train, There's like nothing to do at your homes.
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0427.wav,X,1.6,3.4,2.2,1014,Female,Train," Yes, what happens if the"
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0468.wav,X,4.2,5.0,3.8,1014,Female,Train," Hey. Uh, Ben. Miles, uh, uh, good to see."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0479.wav,X,3.2,3.6,3.4,1014,Female,Train," You know, they fell off all that whenever she goes into transformation thing, whatever."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0494.wav,X,3.4,2.8,3.4,1014,Female,Train," God, me and her just yesterday."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0500.wav,X,3.0,3.8,3.4,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, the foundation got when it goes wrong."
MSP-PODCAST_3004_0664.wav,X,2.4,3.2,3.0,1014,Female,Train," Yeah, Skyla, I think we've got some things to tell you."
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0094.wav,X,4.0,4.2,3.6,1014,Female,Train, But we will turn our things in words to bone.
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0097.wav,X,3.4,2.8,4.0,1014,Female,Train, in further into sounds of chomping and mastication.
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0139.wav,X,3.2,4.4,3.8,1014,Female,Train," and ask him, What? What do you mean?"
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0156.wav,X,2.6,3.4,3.0,1014,Female,Train," Um Well, I'm kind of Lucas and kind of not."
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0219.wav,X,2.2,4.4,2.8,1014,Female,Train, But we also didn't get this one out on Monday.
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0223.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.2,1014,Female,Train, Apple podcasts is being weird as of late and it's kind of hard to tell if we have.
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0276.wav,X,2.4,3.2,3.2,1014,Female,Train," I know that Miles, he got bit by a raccoon and the"
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0279.wav,X,4.0,3.6,4.6,1014,Female,Train," Ah, it says it's a learned behavior though."
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0316.wav,X,3.0,4.2,3.4,1014,Female,Train," I'm do you hear Grandpa Rick often, Ned?"
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0368.wav,X,2.0,3.4,2.8,1014,Female,Train, We use Windex pretty frequently.
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0414.wav,X,1.4,3.0,2.6,1407,Female,Train," Yeah, I think you and Lucas should get some rest."
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0440.wav,X,3.6,3.6,4.2,1407,Female,Train, Cold. Miles is shivering.
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0444.wav,X,4.2,4.6,4.2,1407,Female,Train, So he's a little bit out of his element and like doesn't want to make a fire because he's not sure if he's going to melt down. There's no.
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0695.wav,X,2.6,3.4,2.8,1407,Female,Train, But I don't necessarily think that means we need to trust him.
MSP-PODCAST_3005_0703.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.8,1407,Female,Train," It is cold. Um, my my teeth could use a break from chattering me."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0021.wav,X,3.2,3.4,4.0,1407,Female,Train," You are ignoring the reason for it. All you can feel now is that you're being called, drawn, and drawn."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0030.wav,X,2.6,4.0,2.8,1407,Female,Train, What started your return to sanity to?
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0032.wav,X,3.0,4.2,3.6,1407,Female,Train, We've talked a bit about Skylar's past previously.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0036.wav,X,4.0,3.8,4.0,1407,Female,Train, But for a long time you've been sort of unsure of what exactly he did.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0040.wav,X,2.8,3.8,3.8,1407,Female,Train," It is daytime, so your legs are currently attached and you don't currently have wings."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0043.wav,X,3.0,4.4,3.6,1407,Female,Train," In your cell, you don't remember more than the past few moments."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0048.wav,X,3.4,3.4,4.2,1407,Female,Train, You know that you're sitting on your bed in a cold cell that you hate.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0050.wav,X,2.8,3.4,4.2,1407,Female,Train, Is there anything else about this time that you would like to make clear at all?
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0064.wav,X,3.6,3.2,3.2,1407,Female,Train, You can tell that you have met them many times and have killed them many times.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0074.wav,X,3.2,3.4,3.8,1407,Female,Train, we've had a lot of trouble. Doing anything with you?
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0085.wav,X,2.8,3.4,3.6,1407,Female,Train, pulls up a chair and
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0108.wav,X,3.0,3.0,2.8,1407,Female,Train, Which I will not attempt to imitate to avoid any ignorance or potential insult.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0119.wav,X,4.6,2.8,4.4,1407,Female,Train, But I feel like killing someone over and over is.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0144.wav,X,3.4,3.2,4.0,1407,Female,Train, Above that is a fog.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0151.wav,X,4.2,4.4,4.2,1407,Female,Train, And you finally started to make some progress.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0168.wav,X,4.4,3.2,4.0,1407,Female,Train," Um, I don't think I would contact anyone. I, uh, hmm."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0251.wav,X,2.6,4.0,2.6,1407,Female,Train," Yeah, same. But then those, those stopped being a thing."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0279.wav,X,2.833333,3.5,3.166667,1407,Female,Train, Some help is what we might have needed.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0287.wav,X,4.0,2.8,3.0,1407,Female,Train," Uh, to Ben's house. Uh, sh he lives out in the out in the woods away. I I"
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0303.wav,X,4.6,2.6,4.2,1407,Female,Train," It's gotta be. I had maybe they made a copy or a second one or something, whoever."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0320.wav,X,3.2,3.4,3.8,1407,Female,Train," Um, oh no, Skylar. And, and."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0331.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.4,1407,Female,Train, Are you all okay? We had some weird shit following us to my house.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0347.wav,X,2.8,3.4,3.4,1407,Female,Train," All right, and uh, miles okay too?"
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0372.wav,X,3.6,3.6,3.2,1407,Female,Train," Um, this this landline's probably not the best way to, uh, to contact me."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0377.wav,X,2.8,2.6,3.0,1407,Female,Train, Do you think the government's tapping the landline or something?
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0380.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.0,1407,Female,Train," What we don't know, the foundation, who"
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0381.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.4,1407,Female,Train," However, it's just more secure."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0450.wav,X,3.4,3.8,3.4,1407,Female,Train, So you hadn't started to clean up yet.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0501.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.4,1407,Female,Train, Cool. So that leads me to believe just meta gaming a little bit here at that.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0528.wav,X,2.8,4.2,3.8,1407,Female,Train, Then I would say this is probably act under pressure unless you have a magical way of doing so.
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0692.wav,X,4.0,4.8,4.0,1407,Female,Train," There's trees. Oh yeah, that one has a mark on it."
MSP-PODCAST_3006_0715.wav,X,4.6,5.2,3.8,1407,Female,Train," I mean, I'm not late yet, so I should be, I should be all right."

MSP-PODCAST_3013_0246.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.4,1407,Female,Train," Ned, are you awake and decent?"
MSP-PODCAST_3013_0546.wav,X,3.4,3.8,2.6,1407,Female,Train," But I mean, I haven't."

MSP-PODCAST_3014_0703_0000.wav,X,3.8,3.4,4.2,1407,Female,Train, She said she saw you at the circus recently and there was some shifty stuff with.

MSP-PODCAST_3016_0228.wav,X,4.4,4.2,4.0,1407,Female,Train," Kind of seems like all Ned's mom has done is scold him, so I don't know."
MSP-PODCAST_3016_0669_0000.wav,X,3.8,4.2,4.0,1407,Female,Train, I think this is all a totally alien concept to Miles because he was raised in the foundation and probably didn't get a strong.
MSP-PODCAST_3016_0669_0001.wav,X,4.4,4.6,3.6,1407,Female,Train, religious education as a child.

MSP-PODCAST_3018_0135.wav,X,2.8,2.8,2.2,1407,Female,Train, I think when she first became a clown she was.
MSP-PODCAST_3018_0153.wav,X,3.2,2.6,3.0,1407,Female,Train," So the clowns, sort of what they like to do is kidnap the young and impressionable."

MSP-PODCAST_3018_0542.wav,X,2.0,2.8,2.8,1407,Female,Train," abilities maybe or well, I guess if you also distracted"
MSP-PODCAST_3018_0544.wav,X,2.8,4.0,3.8,1407,Female,Train, It might get the audience to scatter at least.
MSP-PODCAST_3018_0712.wav,X,3.6,3.2,3.4,1407,Female,Train, One of the clowns that.
MSP-PODCAST_3019_0325.wav,X,3.4,3.0,3.4,1407,Female,Train," Something real strange, apparently. You know, everyone's been telling us that, uh, Manny can see everyone at the park."

MSP-PODCAST_3020_0275.wav,X,4.8,3.6,4.2,1407,Female,Train, I think the last thing we want to do is draw more attention to ourselves right now.
MSP-PODCAST_3020_0280.wav,X,2.8,3.6,3.6,1407,Female,Train," Hmm, okay, if you want to just go around and collect them all individually, I guess."
MSP-PODCAST_3021_0131.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.2,1407,Female,Train, I definitely wasn't up super late.

MSP-PODCAST_3022_0161.wav,X,4.2,3.8,3.6,1407,Female,Train," Ned, I guess we should know. Wa, wa, you seem a little out of it."
MSP-PODCAST_3022_0521.wav,X,5.0,3.8,4.8,1407,Female,Train," Are those the things that have been beeping, beep beep beeping? Are those the things that have been beeping this entire goddamn time?"
MSP-PODCAST_3022_0664.wav,X,3.8,4.8,4.2,1407,Female,Train, This is a nasty little treat.
MSP-PODCAST_3022_0677.wav,X,3.6,4.4,4.2,1407,Female,Train," People, freaks, some I regret bringing in."
MSP-PODCAST_3023_0378.wav,X,3.4,3.6,3.4,1407,Female,Train," Uh yeah, I mean, we don't have a whole lot in here."
MSP-PODCAST_3023_0761.wav,X,2.8,3.4,3.0,1407,Female,Train," Um, your, what's your last name?"
MSP-PODCAST_3023_0765.wav,X,3.2,3.0,3.4,1407,Female,Train," Yeah, that's right. I think you're a sister."

MSP-PODCAST_3025_0225.wav,X,3.8,3.6,4.2,1407,Female,Train," It was time to go to the circus or something. Um, then it was signed by him and he said I was asleep so he just left them with me."
MSP-PODCAST_3025_0426.wav,X,4.0,3.8,4.2,1407,Female,Train, Tight? Seems like he wants us to go and pick it up.
MSP-PODCAST_3025_0474.wav,X,3.2,5.0,3.8,1407,Female,Train, That is a fail that I will come back to haunt you.
MSP-PODCAST_3025_0927.wav,X,4.0,4.4,3.8,1407,Female,Train, She is a dangerous individual and I feel like that could cause some issues.
MSP-PODCAST_3025_0987.wav,X,3.2,3.8,3.4,1407,Female,Train," And Agnes, the flyer that you would see is not the flyer."
MSP-PODCAST_3026_0175.wav,X,2.8,3.4,4.0,1407,Female,Train, Next five minutes. It doesn't matter now.
MSP-PODCAST_3026_0345.wav,X,3.2,5.0,3.6,1407,Female,Train," Actually pretty good, I think."

MSP-PODCAST_3051_1061.wav,X,3.2,4.4,3.4,1466,Female,Train," Familiar others, which I think is an area that's ripe for investigation."
MSP-PODCAST_3051_1085.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.2,1466,Female,Train," And what are the odds that like, you know, one person or one lab or this one PI or group of PIs is gonna do it?"
MSP-PODCAST_3051_1117.wav,X,4.2,4.8,3.8,1466,Female,Train," You know, maybe getting a review request or for a paper, which is really cool."
MSP-PODCAST_3051_1158.wav,X,3.4,3.4,3.4,1468,Male,Train, And then I think senior folks like us can also help normal.
MSP-PODCAST_3051_1270.wav,X,4.2,4.2,4.2,1468,Male,Train," Yeah, hopefully we can do more of this and we'll have to pick a new place to get beer, but otherwise."

MSP-PODCAST_3054_0656.wav,X,3.0,4.2,3.8,1466,Female,Train, And then there are other reviewers who sit in on the conversation and ask questions.
MSP-PODCAST_3054_0709.wav,X,3.4,4.2,3.8,1466,Female,Train," So if possible, if you can fit in your research experiences in the form of a narrative, which we know our brain's process."

MSP-PODCAST_5501_0181_0001.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.8,2909,Male,Train, The best I can say is that it.
MSP-PODCAST_5501_0212.wav,X,3.0,3.8,3.4,2909,Male,Train, And then I went to Brandeis University. Interesting.

MSP-PODCAST_5503_0263.wav,X,3.4,2.6,4.8,2911,Male,Train, It is unethical not to be doing psychedelic research.
MSP-PODCAST_5503_0329.wav,X,3.4,4.2,4.0,2911,Male,Train, And I think we actually had a couple more of those guys through.
MSP-PODCAST_5504_0066.wav,X,3.4,4.6,3.6,2911,Male,Train, And what we're hoping to do this evening is.
MSP-PODCAST_5504_0092.wav,X,3.0,4.2,3.8,2911,Male,Train, That a Buddhist helped you participate in.
MSP-PODCAST_5504_0160.wav,X,3.0,4.4,3.8,2912,Male,Train, ways we advertise this event and there were some

MSP-PODCAST_5504_0339.wav,X,3.2,4.2,4.4,2911,Male,Train," But I agree with others, it is best to work on yourself."
MSP-PODCAST_5504_0366.wav,X,3.0,3.6,3.6,2911,Male,Train, We can have lots of questions.
MSP-PODCAST_5504_0603.wav,X,4.2,4.0,4.4,2911,Male,Train, Having a wonderful experience. So we don't know why you're here.
MSP-PODCAST_5504_0613.wav,X,3.4,4.4,4.4,2911,Male,Train, Cause I'll make you speak a little louder. Okay.
MSP-PODCAST_5504_0668.wav,X,3.4,3.0,4.4,2911,Male,Train, Different. And you can see the problem.
MSP-PODCAST_5506_0054.wav,X,3.6,3.8,3.6,2911,Male,Train, The last few decades of his life.
MSP-PODCAST_5506_0095.wav,X,2.8,3.6,4.2,2911,Male,Train," Make the study that you heard about, which may or may not actually happen."
MSP-PODCAST_5513_0492.wav,X,3.0,2.6,3.8,2914,Male,Train, Similar kind of problems with horrible reviewers whose job it was to get us kicked out.
MSP-PODCAST_5516_0191.wav,X,4.0,4.2,4.6,2915,Male,Train, drug and it's legal. five hundred thousand people die.
MSP-PODCAST_5516_0496_0003.wav,X,3.4,3.6,4.0,2915,Male,Train," So if you want to be happy, here's a little bit."
MSP-PODCAST_5517_0197.wav,X,3.8,3.0,4.4,2916,Male,Train, And then there's lots of pharmacotherapy.
MSP-PODCAST_5517_0787.wav,X,3.0,3.6,3.8,2916,Male,Train," Not to compare studies, but to give you a feel for the what that."
MSP-PODCAST_5519_0052.wav,X,2.6,4.0,3.2,2916,Male,Train," The way we approach this is so, has so much flexibility and it's quite nondirectional."
MSP-PODCAST_5519_0210.wav,X,2.4,4.0,3.0,2916,Male,Train, The other another area is this whole issue of multiplicity of the sites.
MSP-PODCAST_5520_0011.wav,X,2.8,4.0,3.6,2916,Male,Train," Yeah, but sometimes we, if that happens repeatedly, we decide, okay, this is a time to."
MSP-PODCAST_5520_0490.wav,X,2.6,4.4,3.6,2916,Male,Train, It was very a very spiritual experience.
MSP-PODCAST_5521_0442.wav,X,3.0,3.4,2.8,2917,Male,Train," It's difficult, but you know, the brain's pretty difficult."
MSP-PODCAST_5521_0558.wav,X,2.8,3.6,4.0,2917,Male,Train, in very similar regions that we saw the effects without.
MSP-PODCAST_5523_0016.wav,X,2.4,4.2,3.4,2918,Male,Train, Michael and Annie were starting their study. I wrote Rick an email.
MSP-PODCAST_5523_0020.wav,X,2.6,3.8,4.4,2918,Male,Train, But there are some differences that I will try.
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0009.wav,X,3.2,4.0,3.6,2921,Male,Train, of those who've been in MDMA assisted psychotherapy.
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0104.wav,X,3.2,3.6,3.6,2921,Male,Train, I think that maybe some of it is starting to happen with maps through maps.
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0147.wav,X,2.4,3.8,3.6,2921,Male,Train, And then a semi structure just means I had follow up questions if it seemed important.
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0261.wav,X,2.6,3.8,4.2,2921,Male,Train," Still, from this point on, she is very careful about the context of her drug use."
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0264_0002.wav,X,2.6,4.4,3.8,2921,Male,Train, So now we can get into the themes.
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0353.wav,X,2.8,3.6,4.0,2921,Male,Train, I'm going to give a different experience or a different portrayal of the other version.
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0415.wav,X,2.6,4.0,3.4,2921,Male,Train," So this is, you know, in the aftermath of time immediately after the session."
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0435.wav,X,3.0,4.0,3.6,2921,Male,Train," So we feel like there's some kind of container here, some semblance of closure."
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0538.wav,X,1.6,3.6,2.0,2921,Male,Train, to the inner experience of the clients.
MSP-PODCAST_5526_0563.wav,X,2.8,4.0,4.2,2921,Male,Train," So yeah, just something that will be important to keep in mind."
MSP-PODCAST_5527_0073.wav,X,2.6,3.2,3.8,2914,Male,Train, So the crackdown was inevitable.
MSP-PODCAST_5527_0212.wav,X,2.6,3.2,4.0,2914,Male,Train, And there's elevation of all these hormones.
MSP-PODCAST_5527_0214.wav,X,2.4,4.0,3.6,2914,Male,Train," And as Rick said, it was put in."
MSP-PODCAST_5527_0331.wav,X,2.6,3.2,3.6,2914,Male,Train, So this was a double blind placebo control.
MSP-PODCAST_5527_0341.wav,X,2.666667,3.666667,3.333333,2914,Male,Train, And also have had at least six months of therapy.
MSP-PODCAST_5527_0379.wav,X,2.0,3.8,3.0,2914,Male,Train," So it's a pretty aesthetically pleasing, very quiet and private."
MSP-PODCAST_5527_0548.wav,X,3.2,4.2,4.0,2914,Male,Train, And then we thought it would be very good.
MSP-PODCAST_5527_0700.wav,X,3.0,3.4,3.4,2914,Male,Train, came for his one year follow up.
MSP-PODCAST_5530_0495_0002.wav,X,2.4,3.8,3.6,263,Female,Train," Because we say, you know, the video is very helpful to us for research."
MSP-PODCAST_5531_0011.wav,X,2.8,4.2,3.6,2918,Male,Train, I'd like to quote Altenwilder.
MSP-PODCAST_5531_0060.wav,X,2.8,4.0,3.2,2918,Male,Train," And surprisingly, from the time that he decided to stop it."
MSP-PODCAST_5531_0092.wav,X,2.6,3.6,3.0,2918,Male,Train, of the results over here.
MSP-PODCAST_5531_0095.wav,X,3.2,4.6,4.0,2918,Male,Train," But with the placebo, cap scores go up till after the third session."
MSP-PODCAST_5531_0112.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.6,2918,Male,Train," After twelve months, the referring therapist told us he was more open, responsive."
MSP-PODCAST_5531_0133.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.8,2918,Male,Train, You can see here the initial caps at baseline. This is.
MSP-PODCAST_5533_0008.wav,X,3.0,4.0,4.0,2923,Male,Train," And this is the talk here, learning from listening."
MSP-PODCAST_5533_0195.wav,X,3.4,4.0,4.0,2923,Male,Train, And that's the blister at all ninety two.
MSP-PODCAST_5533_0337.wav,X,2.8,3.2,4.4,2923,Male,Train, It's not a question that you're asked.
MSP-PODCAST_5534_0145.wav,X,2.8,4.2,4.2,2914,Male,Train," Psyche, of course, is not the mind at all, it's the soul in Greek life."
MSP-PODCAST_5535_0828.wav,X,3.4,4.2,3.8,2926,Male,Train, I would like to say Republican congressman Ben Escheck.
MSP-PODCAST_5535_1191.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.4,263,Female,Train," So we're seeing some sort of progress from Obama, but I'm sorry, what was the question?"
MSP-PODCAST_5535_1231.wav,X,3.0,3.2,4.2,263,Female,Train, We should be able to spend our own money and deal with the FDA.
MSP-PODCAST_5537_0441.wav,X,2.6,3.6,4.2,2928,Female,Train, Discuss the adherence criteria.
MSP-PODCAST_5537_0543.wav,X,3.2,4.4,4.6,2928,Female,Train, And we found a big reduction.
MSP-PODCAST_5537_0579.wav,X,2.6,3.8,3.6,2928,Female,Train," Age twelve, so their creativity is enhanced."
MSP-PODCAST_5537_0609.wav,X,3.6,3.4,3.8,2928,Female,Train, Videotapes and providing a lot of training.
MSP-PODCAST_5538_0202.wav,X,2.8,3.8,3.4,2930,Male,Train, They cut us off from our perception and the integration of that perception.
MSP-PODCAST_5538_0319.wav,X,2.0,3.2,3.4,2930,Male,Train," And the lower the dose, the happier they are, but I don't think the effects are robust or lasting."
MSP-PODCAST_5538_0330_0004.wav,X,3.0,3.8,3.6,2930,Male,Train, And we should value it and use it for transformational work.
MSP-PODCAST_5539_0240.wav,X,3.4,3.2,4.4,2914,Male,Train," My first thought was, this is not very interesting."
MSP-PODCAST_5542_0072.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.8,2914,Male,Train," Well, some people gravitate that way, some people not."
MSP-PODCAST_5542_0224.wav,X,3.4,4.6,4.6,2914,Male,Train, would be relationships and MDMA for relationships.
MSP-PODCAST_5542_0322.wav,X,3.2,2.6,3.2,2932,Female,Train, And they are getting unfairly punished.
MSP-PODCAST_5542_0334.wav,X,2.4,3.4,3.6,2932,Female,Train," And therefore, I think one has to tackle the policy front as well as the sound front."
MSP-PODCAST_5542_0386.wav,X,2.4,3.8,3.6,2932,Female,Train, My name is Tatiana Ginsburg. I'm from Russia.
MSP-PODCAST_5542_0508.wav,X,3.2,2.6,3.8,2914,Male,Train, I think that that is something to be ashamed about. That was a choice that was not one of them.
MSP-PODCAST_5545_0054.wav,X,3.4,4.2,4.0,2936,Male,Train, are going to be important for our talk today.
MSP-PODCAST_5546_0289.wav,X,4.4,3.2,3.4,2937,Male,Train, The traumatic amnesia feels this whole connection is this.
MSP-PODCAST_5547_0040.wav,X,2.8,4.2,3.4,2938,Female,Train, So that's kind of the gist of my talk.
MSP-PODCAST_5547_0087.wav,X,4.4,4.2,3.2,2938,Female,Train, And we are kind of doing the marathon science mental training instead of meditation.
MSP-PODCAST_5547_0159.wav,X,2.8,4.2,4.0,2938,Female,Train, We collected physiology measures. So that's one of our volunteers.
MSP-PODCAST_5547_0200.wav,X,3.0,4.2,4.2,2938,Female,Train, which is interested in neuroplasticity.
MSP-PODCAST_5547_0249.wav,X,4.0,3.4,4.0,2938,Female,Train," I mean, this is so mainstream it's almost hard to imagine where meditation came from."
MSP-PODCAST_5547_0312.wav,X,3.2,4.2,3.6,2938,Female,Train, The better this will kind of help the whole psychedelic science movement.
MSP-PODCAST_5547_0391.wav,X,2.8,4.2,4.2,2938,Female,Train," Okay, and then finally, because I'm just out of time."
MSP-PODCAST_5547_0393.wav,X,3.6,4.6,4.8,2938,Female,Train," The interesting thing is once you give people a hook,"
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0057.wav,X,2.6,3.0,4.2,2939,Male,Train, not particularly remarkable or transformative.
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0066.wav,X,3.6,4.0,4.6,2939,Male,Train, I'd like to read to you one really eloquently written report.
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0092.wav,X,3.2,3.2,3.8,2939,Male,Train, At times I did not recognize myself or time.
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0110.wav,X,2.0,3.4,2.6,2939,Male,Train," I felt homeless, timeless, nameless, bodiless."
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0212.wav,X,3.6,3.4,4.0,2939,Male,Train, for the experience itself that it might be very challenging.

MSP-PODCAST_5548_0347.wav,X,3.6,4.2,3.2,263,Female,Train," Person qualifies over the phone. The next step is oh sorry. Yeah, the next step."
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0402.wav,X,3.2,3.8,4.4,263,Female,Train, Them every minute or less.
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0469.wav,X,3.0,3.8,3.8,263,Female,Train," We've heard that many times, as I will show you here."
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0516.wav,X,4.2,4.2,5.0,263,Female,Train, It reinforces the importance of the whole team.
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0550.wav,X,3.6,3.8,4.6,263,Female,Train," I just politely, with dignity, accept my fate."
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0555.wav,X,2.8,4.2,4.2,2940,Female,Train, supported helped me to let go.
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0611.wav,X,2.4,2.8,4.0,263,Female,Train, The music's bombardment makes it very difficult to breathe.
MSP-PODCAST_5548_0617.wav,X,3.2,2.8,4.8,263,Female,Train, It's the last thing I want because I don't want to face the music anymore.
MSP-PODCAST_5549_0004.wav,X,2.8,4.2,3.8,2941,Male,Train," There's a link you can just click and actually receive the whole thing, which is a ten year."
MSP-PODCAST_5550_0014.wav,X,4.6,4.4,4.8,2942,Male,Train, Words. It is a breathy whistle.
MSP-PODCAST_5550_0044_0000.wav,X,4.8,3.8,5.0,2942,Male,Train," Its preparation, its song by taking the plant inside the body."
MSP-PODCAST_5552_0146.wav,X,2.4,4.4,4.0,2944,Male,Train," history rather than their history of criminal recreational use, the history of prohibition, not not."
MSP-PODCAST_5552_0167.wav,X,3.6,4.2,4.2,2944,Male,Train, headlines and the willingness of editors to accept them.
